Pre-history
Bitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. 

Conception to Launch
On October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous <a href="https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous "The Times" headline in the <a href="https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction">coinbase</a> both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.

Post Launch
<a href="https://messari.io/person/hal-finney">Hal Finney</a>, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer <a href="https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz">Laszlo Hanyecz</a> bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. 

In August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.

In December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to <a href="https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen">Gavin Andresen</a>.

Silk Road & Mt. Gox
One of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder <a href="https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht">Ross Ulbricht</a>, and shuttering the site.

Founded by <a href="https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb">Jed McCaleb</a> in July 2010, and led by <a href="https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles">Mark Karpeles</a> until it collapsed, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/mtgox">Mt. Gox</a> was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.

2017 Bubble & Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork
The 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.

Also notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its <a href="https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork">most contentious fork to date</a>. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the "New York Agreement". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate <a href="https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness">SegWit</a> without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.

2018 - 2019
After peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.

Since it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently <a href="https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness">announced</a> blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.

2020 - 2021
Bitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip – in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.

Bitcoin’s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum’s firey <a href="https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer">DeFi summer</a>, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn’t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.

Bitcoin’s price wasn’t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Michael Saylor of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin">continue</a> to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren’t alone – entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company <a href="https://messari.io/organization/zap">Zap</a> to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin

It was proposed in reaction to a plan referred to as "Segwit2x" which was an agreement among miners, developers, businesses, and investors to support SegWit (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). Users rejected this proposal and deployed a user-activated soft fork in a demonstration that users controlled the Bitcoin network.

BIP 141 defined a new structure called a "witness" that is committed to blocks separately from the transaction Merkle tree. This structure contains data required to check transaction validity but not required to determine transaction effects. In particular, scripts and signatures are moved into this new structure.
BIP 143 defines a new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification in version 0 witness program, in order to minimize redundant data hashing in verification and to cover the input value by the signature
BIP 147 proposed changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules to fix a malleability vector in the extra stack element consumed by OPCHECKMULTISIG and OPCHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
BIP 148 Defined soft fork flag day activation of the segregated witness deployment known as "segwit". Activated BIP141, BIP143, and BIP147. The date was set for August 1, 2017, when users would decide whether or not to deploy SegWit"

  "It's a complicated area. Because, as you said, there are different types of cryptoassets. Let me try and divide them into two areas. A pure medium of exchange, the one that's most often cited, is Bitcoin. As a replacement for currency, that has been determined by most people to not be a security.

  Then there are tokens, which are used to finance projects. I've been on the record saying there are very few, there's none that I've seen, tokens that aren't securities. To the extent something is a security, we should regulate it as a security, and our securities regulations are disclosure-based, and people should follow those and provide the information that we require"

The CRC is a member-owned and operated organization whose purpose is to assess if a crypto asset, or its development, issuance, and use have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws. According to the CRC framework, a score of 5 results when an asset appears to have many characteristics that are consistent with the Howey-test factors. A score of 1 results when an asset appears to have few characteristics that are consistent with the Howey-test factors.",

The rate at which new bitcoins are created is algorithmically cut in half roughly every 4 years (210,000 blocks). Bitcoin has gone through three halvings to date; November 2012, July 2016 and most recently in May 2020. Since blocks are generated every 10 minutes on average and starting at 50 new bitcoins per block when the system was launched in 2009, this creates a very well-defined supply curve. 

The stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy
Bitcoin's monetary policy is disinflationary. The annual rate of inflation decreases through time. The current supply cap of Bitcoin is set at 21 million coins. The stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy provided by this well-defined supply cap and halving schedule is a key differentiator versus other crypto assets.

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a <a href="https://messari.io/resource/sha-256">SHA-256</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hash</a> less than the target number set by Bitcoin's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every 2016 blocks.

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Bitcoin mining is now dominated by <a href="https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASICs</a> situated in enterprise-scale data centers. In order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.

technology_details: ""Bitcoin" is a label used for a protocol and a currency.

Bitcoin, the currency, is bits of data usable outside the limitations of the protocol using second-layer solutions like <a href="https://messari.io/resource/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> payment channels. 

Bitcoin, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of <a href="https://messari.io/resource/utxo">unspent transaction output</a> (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 1MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic <a href="https://messari.io/resource/node">nodes</a> maintains this ledger by validating, propagating, and fighting to include <a href="https://messari.io/resource/mempool">mempool</a> transactions in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka "full nodes") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.

Mining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.

Mining difficulty regularly adjusts to maintain Bitcoin's average ten-minute block schedule. Mining nodes add new blocks to whatever chain has the largest accumulated proof of work maintained by a network of economic nodes with downloaded copies of the same chain.

details: "On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or blockchain, which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins. On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoin's history."

type: "Inflation",
details: "On September 17, Bitcoin Core developers discovered that older versions of Bitcoin Core will crash if they try to process a block containing a transaction that attempts to spend the same input twice. Such blocks are invalid, so they can only be created by a miner willing to sacrifice their allowed income for creating a block of at least 12.5 BTC (about $80,000 USD as of this writing). 

Soon after discovering the DDoS attack vulnerability, Bitcoin Core developers also discovered an inflation bug which they quickly determined had the same root cause and fix. They decided to disclose the DDoS vulnerability immediately while keeping the inflation bug quiet. This provided developers time to reach out to miners, businesses, and other affected systems about upgrading their software, while also providing additional time to fix the exploit.

governance: {
governance_details: "Model Overview
Bitcoin governance is the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.

Process Overview
Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit <a href="https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a> ("BIPs"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.

Once rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. 

User Activated Hard Fork
2017's <a href="https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork">User Activated Soft Fork Event</a> provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. 

As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the "New York Agreement". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support <a href="https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness">SegWit</a> (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). 

Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named <a href="https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry">Shaolinfry</a>. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. 

Many see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin.

background_details: "Conception to token sale
<a href="https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> conceived Ethereum in 2013, after what he perceived as limitations in the functionality of Bitcoin’s scripting language, namely the lack of Turing completeness. Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building <a href="https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">BTC</a> (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.

The rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)
Ethereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/augur">REP</a>) conducted the first <a href="https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the <a href="https://messari.io/article/erc-20">ERC-20</a> standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.

The DAO hack
In April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as <a href="https://messari.io/asset/the-dao">The DAO</a> hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic">$ETC</a>).

The path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0
Scalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.

The potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).

Ethereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security. The following phases are being developed in parallel but might take several years before they reach completion.",

title: "Olympic",
date: "2015-05-01T04:00:00Z",
type: "Testnet Launch",
details: "Olympic was the final Ethereum proof-of-concept released before mainnet launch. Its stated purpose was to reward participants for testing the limits of the Ethereum design by “spamming the network with transactions and doing crazy things with the state.” The event included a competition that offered a pool of 25,000 ETH (a href="https://messari.io/article/incentivizing-testnet-participation"~0.03% of Ethereum's initial supply/a) for the top miner and developer participants. Broad testnet engagement unearthed critical bugs and simple optimizations in the live system that the core team was able to identify and resolve pre-mainnet. Ethereum core developers deprecated Olympic when Frontier launched in favor of Mordon, the Frontier-equivalent public testnet."
},
{
title: "Frontier (mainnet launch)",
date: "2015-07-30T04:00:00Z",
type: "Network Launch",
details: "Frontier marked the official 1.0 release of the Ethereum mainnet and introduced a series of new characteristics, including a block reward, a temporary gas block limit, and Canary contracts. The Frontier launch enabled miners to start receiving real ETH as a reward for their efforts, with the initial block subsidy consisting of five ETH per valid block. Version 1.0 also featured a hardcoded gas limit of 5000 gas per block to prevent any issues with node installation. The gas limit lasted only a few days post-launch before being automatically removed. To avoid unwanted chain forks, Frontier contained Canary contracts as well. Canary contracts gave Ethereum core developers the ability to stop specific operations or transactions before a miner wandered off to an orphaned chain. These contracts meant the final execution of transactions remained centralized in Ethereum's early stages."
},
{
title: "Homestead",
date: "2016-03-14T04:00:00Z",
type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "Homestead was the first planned hard fork of Ethereum and took place at block number 1,150,000. The upgrade removed the Canary contracts used in Frontier, thus eliminating the centralized process for executing transactions, and introduced the now widely-used Solidity smart contracts. It also included the (now deprecated) Mist wallet, the first user interface (UI) for storing and transacting tokens, as well as writing and deploying smart contracts.

Furthermore, Homestead was one of the first implementations of a href="https://messari.io/article/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip"Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)/a, and the upgrade introduced three new EIPs upon activation:
EIP-2 (which included sub-proposals EIPs 2.1-2.4) ensured ACID compliance (all-or-nothing) for contract deployments and helped stabilize block times
EIP-7 added the DELETECALL opcode
EIP-8 equipped client software with the ability to accommodate future network protocol updates"

title: "Spurious Dragon",
date: "2016-11-22T05:00:00Z",
type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "The Spurious Dragon hard fork activated at block 2,675,000, which arrived on Nov. 22, 2019. The upgrade introduced four code changes:
EIP-155 offered protection from replay attacks
EIP-160 increase the price of the EXP opcode to make it more challenging to slow down the network with computationally intensive operations
EIP-161 makes it possible to remove large numbers of empty accounts to reduced blockchain state size
EIP-170 set a limit for the code size a smart contract can contain to prevent repetitive attacks on large pieces of code

date: "2017-10-16T04:00:00Z",
type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "Byzantium was the first phase of the proposed Metropolis upgrade and activated at block 4,370,000. The Byzantium hard fork included nine EIPs, with EIP-100, EIP-658, and EIP-649, introducing the most significant code changes.
EIP-100 adjusted the difficulty formula to stabilize the ETH issuance rate
EIP-658 added a new field to transaction receipts to indicate success or failure
EIP-649 delayed the difficulty bomb (i.e., the Ethereum "ice age") by one year and reduced the block subsidy from five to three ETH
Details on the remaining Byzantium EIPs are available here.

{
title: "Metropolis: Constantinople/St. Petersburg",
date: "2019-02-28T05:00:00Z",
type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "Constantinople, the second phase of Metropolis, was initially scheduled to go live at block 7,080,000 (January 16, 2019). But on January 15, 2019, security auditing firm ChainSecurity discovered a vulnerability in one of the accepted EIPs that would enable a reentrancy attack (i.e., the opportunity for an attacker to steal user funds similar to The DAO hack). Core Ethereum developers and some projects running on the network voted to delay Constantinople until the developers closed the security loophole.

After a month-long delay, Constantinople and its security patch, St. Petersburg, went live at block 7,280,000, introducing five new code changes to the network:
EIP-145 added Bitwise shifting instructions to the EVM, making the execution of shifts in smart contracts significantly cheaper
EIP-1052 expedited inter-smart contract verification (smart contract can verify each other via a hash rather than the entire code set)
EIP-1014 improved state channel integrations to facilitate the connection to off-chain scaling solutions
EIP-1283 reduced costs for executing multiple updates within a single transaction (aka the SSTORE opcode)
EIP-1234 delayed the difficulty bomb for another year and reduced the mining reward from three to two ETH per block (the reduction is also known as the "Thirdening")

details: "The first phase of Istanbul is set to activate at block 9,069,000, almost two months after its initially scheduled launch (Oct. 16, 2019). Istanbul Phase I intends to introduce six new EIPs upon activation to help optimize opcode computational costs, improve denial-of-service attack security, and enhance the performance of layer-2 solutions using a href="https://messari.io/article/zk-snark"ZK-SNARKs/a or a href="https://messari.io/article/zk-stark"ZK-STARKs/a, among other advancements. The accepted EIPs include:
EIP-152 adds the ability to verify Zcash-to-Ethereum atomic swaps
EIP-1108 reduces the costs for ZK-SNARKs
EIP-1344 improves smart contract ability, especially those used by layer-2 solutions, to track the correct base chain during a hard fork
EIP-1844 restructures the costs of specific a href="https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)/a opcodes to deter spamming attacks and to match each operation with its required level of computation
EIP-2028 reduces the cost of calling data within transactions and the fees associated with ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs
EIP-2200 alters the cost of storage in the EVM and allows smart contracts to generate more creative functions

type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "The Muir Glacier hard fork activated at block 9,200,000, which arrived on Jan. 2, 2020. The upgrade only included EIP-2384, which delayed Ethereum's inherent "Difficulty Bomb" for another 4,000,000 blocks (approximately 611 days) to prevent block times from increasing (and usability plummeting). Muir Glacier's abrupt arrival, less than a month after Istanbul, marked the third time Ethereum core developers opted to delay the Difficulty Bomb (aka Ice Age).

title: "Istanbul (Phase II): Berlin",
date: null,
type: "Hard Fork Upgrade",
details: "The launch of Berlin, the second step of the Istanbul upgrade, should occur at some point in 2020. Ethereum core developers split Istanbul into two phases because two of the EIPs up for discussion require extensive testing and development before launch. At the moment, core devs have approved and raised two EIPs to accepted status. There are two other proposed EIPs that may be ready in time for Berlin.

Accepted
EIP-2315 implements simple subroutines for the EVM which could lower gas costs and make states analysis easier
EIP 2537 (which superseded EIP-1962) implements a single BLS curve to make it easier to deploy and manage rollup contracts and zk-SNARKs/STARKs

Proposed
EIP-2046 reduces the gas cost for static calls made to precompiled contracts
EIP-2565 will re-price the ModExp precompile (EIP-198) to enable more cost-efficient verification of RSA signatures, verifiable delay functions (VDFs), and primality checks, among other functions

Istanbul Phase II notably excludes any EIPs related to the difficulty bomb (i.e., the Ethereum "ice age"). The core developers concluded, "there's no major reason do it now" because the difficulty bomb is only necessary once Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are activated. Overlooking an Ice Age EIP for now also prevents any further delays in Berlin's development phase.

Core devs and the greater Ethereum community also excludes the EIP-1057, the proposal for the now-infamous ProgPoW (short for Progressive Proof-of-Work). It aimed to alter Ethereum's hashing algorithm to close the performance efficiency gap between generalized and specialized mining hardware (otherwise known as ASICs). While GPU miners and some core devs favored the proposal, many in the community were vehemently against it. Therefore, all sides agree to a href="https://messari.io/article/progpow-wars-ethereum-dev-call-places-a-spotlight-on-the-progpow-debate"not include ProgPoW/a in any upcoming forks as no protocol changes are worth triggering a network split

title: "Serenity Phase 0",
date: "2020-12-01T00:00:00Z",
type: "Network Launch",
details: "Serenity Phase 0 marks Ethereum's initial transition to Ethereum 2.0. This initial phase will introduce the Beacon Chain, which will serve as the backbone for Ethereum 2.0's sharded network architecture. As opposed to Ethereum's current Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain, the Beacon Chain will use Casper FFG, a specific variation of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and a system of validators to confirm transactions and inhibit Sybil attacks.

Ethereum core developers split the Serenity upgrade into three phases to optimize the development process and limit deployment risks. The specifications for this first phase include:
Beacon Chain is the core of the Ethereum 2.0 system; it manages the PoS protocol for itself and all of the individual shard chains. The Beacon chain will use Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper FFG) to ensure transaction finality.
Fork Choice enables validators' clients to automatically select the right chain when the Phase 0 Serenity fork is initiated
Deposit Contract allows Ethereum stakeholders to transfer funds from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 and claim rights to a validator role on the new PoS chain
Honest Validator dictates the expected behavior of an "honest validator and slashing specifications with respect to Phase 0 of ETH 2.0

It is essential to note the launch of Phase 0 will not immediately replace Ethereum 1.0 (also known as Ethereum 1.x). The two chains will coexist for at least until Serenity Phase 1.5 arrives, which marks when the current Ethereum chain will merge into the Ethereum 2.0 system a shard within the network. Running the legacy and future chains in parallel may cause ETH inflation to increase as both chains will simultaneously mint new tokens."

{
title: "EIP-1559",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "EIP-1559 was authored by Vitalik Buterin and Eric Conner, among others. It aims to replace Ethereum's "first-price auction" fee model with a base network fee that could change based on network demand. The goal is to create a more efficient fee market and simplify the gas payment process for client and application software, removing the potential for users to pay unnecessarily high gas fees. EIP-1559 also proposes burning the base network fee to help keep this fee low and ETH inflation in check."

{
title: "Serenity Phase 1",
date: null,
type: "Network Upgrade",
details: "Phase 1 will introduce 64 independent shard chains to the ETH 2.0 network. Shard chains will not execute state or keep track of account balances, as the phase intends to only test the construction and validity of shard chains with the Beacon chain. ETH 1.0 will continue to run in parallel with ETH 2.0 throughout this phase."
},
{
title: "Serenity Phase 1.5: ETH1 <> ETH2 merge",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "A proposal for merging the current Ethereum network with Ethereum 2.0 first introduced by Vitalik Buterin. The proposal intends to remove the Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain by moving everything onto the Beacon Chain on an accelerated schedule. This accelerated merge requires stateless clients on Ethereum 1.x, which would remove the need for most nodes to store the entire state altogether."
},
{
title: "Serenity Phase 2",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "The final phase of Serenity will add full-functionality to shard chains, enabling them to execute transactions and maintain account balances. It also introduces the eWASM virtual machine, which will replace the EVM."

regulatory_details: "On June 14, 2018, the U.S. SEC's Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, revealed that the SEC does not consider ether (ETH) to be a security.
  "Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions."

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton later <a href="https://messari.io/article/sec-chairman-clayton-confirms-commission-staff-analysis-that-found-ethereum-is-not-a-security">confirmed</a> Hinman's analysis on Mar. 12, 2019, stating ether and similar cryptocurrencies do not fall under securities law. Clayton carried on to say that the Howey test framework, the test used by the SEC to determine if certain transactions qualify as "investment contracts," is not static. Therefore, digital tokens first defined as securities can shift to non-securities over time, depending on how they are managed and exchanged.

U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Heath Tarbert echoed the SEC's findings in Oct. 2019, adding that he views ether as a commodity.
  “We've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether—until now. It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.”

While ether in its current state is not a security, U.S. regulators have not commented on the legality of Ethereum's crowdsale. But Chairman Clayton did mention that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) look like unregistered securities sales.",

Block Rewards, Block Time, Hard Forks and Issuance Rate

New ether are generated via block rewards, initially set at 5 Ether per block. Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As <a href="https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:
  "This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners."

In 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as "ice age" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.

The Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, <a href="https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon">Afri Schoeden</a> proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.

On February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.

The Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug

On November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the "library" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. <a href="https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods">Messari Proprietary Methodology</a> to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.

ETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake

In ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by <a href="https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. 

<a href="https://messari.io/person/justin-drake">Justin Drake</a>, a researcher at the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a>, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.

The transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:
Phase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.
Phase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.
Phase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.
Phase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.

consensus_details: "Modified GHOST protocol
The Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the "longest" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. <a href="https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, the implementation used by Bitcoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">$BTC</a>) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.

The GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.

Some say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.

Mining
Ethereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.

Cryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href="https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork). Ethereum also plans to transition to a <a href="https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus model, which would render any mining equipment obsolete.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Account-based model
Ethereum is an account-based blockchain consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href="https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href="https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.

Ethereum Virtual Machine
The heart of the Ethereum blockchain is known as the <a href="https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, which is the part of the protocol that executes transactions. It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.

Developer tools and token standards
Ethereum adopted <a href="https://messari.io/article/erc-20">Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20</a> in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.

Ethereum 2.0
As Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work</a> to <a href="https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Stake</a> and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.",

In response, Ethereum developers opted to initiate a hard fork at block 2463000 (Oct. 18, 2016) to implement EIP-150, which addressed the issue of underpriced operation codes to make future DDoS attacks cost-prohibitive. The Ethereum team initially proposed issuing a second hard fork upgrade to introduce EIP-158. But they later decided to replace it with EIP-161, which they included in the Spurious Dragon hard fork."

governance: {
governance_details: "Ethereum operates similarly to Bitcoin through off-chain, informal governance. In this model, developers can submit protocol upgrades, dubbed <a href="https://messari.io/article/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip">Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)</a>, on Ethereum's open-source GitHub repository. Core Ethereum developers then discuss new proposals, with additional input from the extended community. If approved by a majority vote, core developers merge the changes into the base code. To avoid complications post-merge, node operators must update their clients to the latest software.",
onchain_governance: {
onchain_governance_type: "No On-Chain Governance",
onchain_governance_details: "While Ethereum does not have an official on-chain governance model, it does have a history with coin voting. The three instances listed below are examples of loosely couple coin voting:
- [DAO proposal votes](https://daostats.github.io/proposals.html)
- [The DAO Carbonvote](http://v1.carbonvote.com/)
- [The EIP 186/649/669 Carbonvote](http://carbonvote.com/)

Loosely coupled coin voting still coordinates the details of the proposal off-chain, but participants submit their votes on-chain, with each vote weighted by the total amount of ether held by that address. Despite the correlation between voting weight and tokens held, users do not submit tokens alongside their votes and are therefore not subject to any direct financial burden. Hence, the loosely coupled label given to this style of governance by Vitalik Buterin.

Ethereum does not have any examples of coin voting as a built-in layer-1 protocol feature (referred to as tightly couple coin voting). But networks miners engage in a tightly couple voting process when determining whether to change the block gas limit.

See more details in Vitalik Buterin's [blog post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html) on blockchain governance",

background_details: "Founded in July 2014 by <a href="https://messari.io/person/brock-pierce">Brock Pierce</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/person/craig-sellars">Craig Sellars</a>, and <a href="https://messari.io/person/reeve-collins">Reeve Collins</a>, Tether (USDT), originally known as "Realcoin", is a cryptocurrency commonly known as a “<a href="https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins">stablecoin</a>” that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the U.S. dollar. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.

Tether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based <a href="https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited">Tether Ltd</a> is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. 

Exchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include <a href="https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/bittrex">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd">Binance</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/kraken">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/huobi">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/poloniex">Poloniex</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/liquid">Liquid.io</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/gate-io">Gate.io</a>, and <a href="https://messari.io/organization/okex">OKEx</a>. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc">iFinex Inc</a>.

Since its founding in 2014, Tether has been the <a href="https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether">subject of ongoing controversy </a>due to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.

In March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.

In April 2019, the New York Attorney General’s office alleged that Bitfinex, who shares the same parent company, iFiniex, with Tether, used reserves from Tether to cover up $850 million in losses that were tied up in a controversial third party payments processor named <a href="https://messari.io/organization/crypto-capital-4">Crypto Capital</a>. Days after the NYAG's action, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex and Tether, filed an affidavit confirming that Tether was backed by only 74% cash and equivalents with the rest being equity in iFinex.

In May 2019, Bitfinex and Tether CTO, <a href="https://messari.io/person/paolo-ardoino">Paulo Ardoino</a> announced Bitfinex had successfully raised $1 billion in a token sale, with proceeds used to cover the $850 million in (potentially) lost funds from Crypto Capital.",

background: {
background_details: "Founded in 2012 by <a href="https://messari.io/person/chris-larsen">Chris Larsen</a> and <a href="https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb">Jed McCaleb</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ripple">Ripple</a> (Formerly known as Opencoin) is a technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol. Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of <a href="https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger">Ryan Fugger</a>, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.

In 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, <a href="https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz">David Schwartz</a>, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). 

In 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.

After the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.

To further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a <a href="https://messari.io/article/bitlicense">BitLicense</a> from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. 

Today XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ripple">Ripple</a>'s xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.

To date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).

title: "v0.90.0",
date: "2018-02-20T05:00:00Z",
type: "Mainnet",
details: "Introduced several features and enhancements that improve the reliability, scalability, and security of the XRP Ledger.
Highlights of this release include:
The DepositAuth amendment, which lets an account strictly reject any incoming money from transactions sent by other accounts.
The Checks amendment, which allows users to create deferred payments that can be canceled or cashed by their intended recipients.
History Sharding, which allows rippled servers to distribute historical ledger data if they agree to dedicate storage for segments of ledger history.
New Preferred Ledger by Branch semantics which improves the logic that allows a server to decide which ledger it should base future ledgers on when there are multiple candidates."
},
{
title: "1.0.0",
date: "2018-05-15T04:00:00Z",

20% was retained by the founders of XRP. Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb each received 9.5 billion XRP. Arthur Britto received 1 billion XRP.
77.8% was allocated to Ripple
0.2% was airdropped as an experiment to try and expand usage as part of the launch.

In 2014, Chris Larsen committed 7 billion XRP from his allocation to a charitable foundation. Jed McCaleb donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor-advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement. Today, Ripple’s selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb allow him to sell his allocation at a theoretical maximum rate of 1% of daily trading volume.

supply_curve_details: "XRP outstanding supplied is designed to be deflationary. XRP is burned to pay fees for transactions via Ripplenet. Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. 

In December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.

Ripple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:
Programmatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. 
Direct sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.

Ripple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. 

Our liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day. 

To date, Messari released to in-depth research on Ripple supply management:

consensus: {
consensus_details: "The XRP Ledger is managed by an independent network of validators that constantly compare their transaction records. Any server can join to become a Ripple validator and define their own list of trusted nodes; however, in order to ensure a high degree of overlap for the network to reliably reach consensus, Ripple publishes a list of recommended validators called the "Unique Node List" (UNL) that validators consider when building consensus.

Consensus is built through a multi-round process where UNL validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their trusted validators proposed. This process occurs until a supermajority (80%) of UNL nodes have matching ledgers. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a supermajority (80%) of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.",

overview: {
technology_details: "XRP's foundation is a shared public ledger used by network participants to exchange value globally. A supermajority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.

Ripple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. 

For users just getting started, Ripple Inc. maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.

Cross-currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.

To encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Invoicing and wallet solutions allow businesses to incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.

While each server defines its own trusted validators, in order to ensure a high degree of overlap for the network to reliably reach consensus, Ripple publishes a list of recommended validators called the "Unique Node List" (UNL). Only the votes of the other members of the UNL are considered when determining consensus, giving Ripple the ability to significantly influence who gets to participate in consensus and who does not. Furthermore, Ripple also participates at the network level of the XRP Ledger, validating transactions. ",

background: {
background_details: "Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange that launched in the summer of 2017 and swiftly grew to become one of the world's largest by trading volume, making a profit of $200 million in its second full quarter of operation. Binance Coin is an ERC-20 token that was issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) to be used for discounted trading costs, with a percentage of the tokens burned every quarter.

ERC-20 tokens were replaced by native tokens when Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain, in April 2019. The team constructed Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that allows traders to keep custody of their cash, on top of Binance Chain. Over time, the token has gained additional functionality, such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and different payments in the Binance ecosystem.

CEO Changpeng Zhao ("CZ") has also stated that 90% of Binance employees opt to earn a portion of their income in BNB.",

Most crypto exchanges charge trading fees based on a small percentage of total trade size. Binance was the first to offer discounts on these trading fees if they were paid in the native exchange token. The discount started at 50% for the first year getting reduced to 25% in the second, 12.5% in the third and finally 6.75% in the fourth before being eliminated entirely. These discounts are at the sole discretion of Binance and could be altered at any time.  

Launchpad
As a <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-crypto-capital-markets">progression </a>of the ICO, Binance first popularized the <a href="https://messari.io/resource/initial-exchange-offering-ieo">initial exchange offering (IEO)</a> when they announced in January 2019 that they would be selling tokens directly through the exchange every month. Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. 

Binance Chain
BNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network. It initially operates with a small pre-selected validator set, but the plan is to transition to a <a href="https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism where users can vote using their BNB for delegates that will validate blocks to secure the network. There is also a built-in governance module to let BNB holders submit proposals by depositing tokens which are then voted on.

launch_details: "
Binance pre-mined 200 million Binance Coins prior to the public sale. Binance Coin’s distribution process had three phases: allocation to founders, allocation to investors, and a public sale.  
Founders received 80 million BNB (40% of supply) vested over four years. Half of the founders’ allocation was vested immediately. The other half is vested annually through 2021. From Q2 2019, these tokens will be burnt through quarterly burns and will thus remain illiquid until they are burnt.  Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.
Investors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. 
The public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.

Binance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019. Binance Coins native to the Binance chain are called BEP2 BNB. Pre-selected validators produced blocks after the genesis block on April 18, 2019, and the first ERC-20 to BEP2 BNB swap of 5 million BNB was executed to a wallet belonging to Binance."

supply_curve_details: "Binance initially stated that it would used 20% of the quarterly profits generated by its exchange to buy back BNB on the market and burn them, thus reducing the outstanding supply.  Nevertheless, in April 2019, Binance edited the white paper’s section devoted to quarterly repurchasing plans to replace it with a section on quarterly burn plans. In July 2019, Binance announced that it will burn the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team going forward. As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt. This reduces BNB's liquid supply, as these tokens are no longer liquid, but it also reduces the potential liquid supply inflation rate that would have occurred through the vesting of those tokens. 

As of today, Binance has realized 15 quarterly token burns, leading to the destruction of 30,567,063 BNB:

October 2017 - 986,000 BNB
January 2018 -  1,821,586 BNB
April 2018 -  2,220,314 BNB

Two months earlier, Binance chain’s testnet launched and was used by the internal Binance team and some high-volume traders for testing. 

Binance’s decentralized exchange (DEX) is built on the Binance blockchain using Tendermint and the Cosmos Software Developer Kit (SDK). Binance forked Cosmos to create the Binance blockchain, which currently does not support smart contract features. Binance aims to use the Tendermint consensus framework to solve some interoperability problems with inter-blockchain communication (IBC). 

Binance chain source code is currently not open source for competitiveness reasons, according to Binance. But the exchange plans to open source the DEX and blockchain codebases when both products gain more adoption.

Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History (PoH) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.",

background: {
background_details: "Solana's origins date back to late 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft detailing a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH). In blockchains like Bitcoin and Etheruem, one of the limitations to scalability is the time required to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Anatoly believed his new technique could automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains, providing a key piece that would enable crypto networks to scale well-beyond their capabilities at the time.

Anatoly later teamed up with former Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald to build a single blockchain network in Rust that used PoH as its "internal clock." The two released the first internal testnet (with demo) and official version of the project's whitepaper in Feb. 2018. Another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, suggested that offloading signature verification to graphics processors could further increase transaction throughput (i.e., scalability). Anatoly recruited Greg and Stephen, and three others to found the company that would eventually become Solana Labs. The founding team included former Apple engineers in addition to the Qualcomm veterans. They initially named the project Loom but later rebranded it to Solana to avoid confusion with the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, Loom Network.

Solana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018. Between Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.

Solana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support. But it did not include any staking rewards as Solana was still determining its ongoing issuance schedule. The current plan is to upgrade from its current beta stage to a more production-ready version in either later 2020 or early 2021.

At the moment, Solana Labs remains a core contributor to the Solana network, while the Solana Foundation helps fund ongoing development and community building efforts.",

Additional participants included Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures. The firms received SOL tokens in exchange for their investments, although the number of tokens allocated to investors was not disclosed. Solana announced the new capital would be pushed toward engineering and project management. See more details here.

In 2020, Solana raised its fourth private sale (dubbed a Strategic Sale) and held a public auction sale hosted by CoinList, which brought in another ~$4 million combined. The remaining tokens from the initial SOL supply will go to Solana Labs team members, the Solana Foundation (to help fund development and balance validator voting power), and a "community reserve" (also managed by the Solana Foundation) to fund community initiatives and application developers.

The initial distribution of SOL tokens is as follows:
15.86% to Seed Round investors
2.63 to Founding Sale investors
5.07% to Validator Sale investors
1.84% to Strategic Sale investors
1.6% to Public Auction Sale investors

Solana's three pre-launch private sales all came with a nine-month lockup after the network launched. The tokens issued in these sales should become liquid around Jan. 7, 2021. The project's public auction sale (held in Mar. 2020) did not come with a lockup schedule, and the SOL tokens distributed in that sale (which totaled 1.6% of the initial supply) were fully liquid once the network launched.

The founder's allocation (12.5% of the initial supply) will also be subject to a nine-month lockup post-network launch. After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).

The Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe. The entire allocations for these categories will unlock in Jan. 2021.

The Solana Foundation's allocation began vesting in small increments every month following the network's launch. The foundation also unlocked 11,365,067 SOL at launch to lend to a market maker for six months. After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.

Ongoing Emissions
Solana validators voted to enable <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228">"pico-inflation"</a> on Dec. 24, 2020. The SOL supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1%, with newly minted tokens going to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts. This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.

This "final" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% ("dis-inflation rate"). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.",

consensus: {
consensus_details: "Solana's Proof of Stake (PoS) based consensus mechanism, specifically called Tower BFT, leverages the network's Proof of History (PoH) technique as a clock before consensus to reduce communication overhead and latency.

Each time a validator votes on a particular fork, voting is restricted to a fixed period of hashes called a slot. The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.

As an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2³² slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.

The Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.

Any individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times. Due to the GPU requirement, hardware expectations are slightly higher than some protocols. Estimated costs for a satisfactory setup are around $5,000.",

technology_details: "Solana’s highly performant blockchain is built using the eight innovations:
Proof of History: A clock before consensus
Tower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT
Turbine: A block propagation protocol
Gulfstream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol
Sealevel: World’s first parallel smart contracts run-time
Pipelining: Transaction processing unit for validation
Cloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database
Archivers: Distributed ledger storage

Proof of History: A clock before consensus
The biggest challenge in distributed networks is agreeing on the time and sequence in which events occurred as nodes within the network can’t trust the timestamp on messages received from other nodes. Solana attempts to solve this with Proof of History (PoH) by creating a cryptographically secure source of time across the network. Proof of History is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which requires a specific number of sequential steps to evaluate but produces a unique output that can be publicly verified. This means that nodes can create the next block without having to coordinate with the entire network first because they can trust the timestamp and ordering of the messages that they’ve received. The result is a reduction in consensus overhead.

Tower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT
On top of Proof of History, Solana runs its consensus mechanism called Tower BFT, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that leverages the synchronized clock enabled by PoH to achieve consensus on network transactions. At a high level, each time a node on the network votes on a particular fork, they commit to a certain amount of time where they are locked out from voting on an opposing fork. This period where they are locked out grows exponentially as they continue to vote on the same fork until they achieve a maximum lockout at 32 votes for the same fork. Nodes on the network will only receive inflation rewards when they reach this maximum vote lockout; therefore, it is in their interest to continue voting on the fork they believe the supermajority of the network is voting for.

Turbine: A block propagation protocol
Solana transmits blocks (communicates blocks between validators) independently of consensus, using a separate but connected protocol called Turbine. Turbine borrows heavily from BitTorrent and is optimized for streaming. As a block is streamed, it is broken up into small packets along with erasure codes, and then fanned out across a large set of random peers.

Gulf Stream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol
In a high-performance network, mempool management presents a new class of problems when it comes to the cost of filtering and maintaining a rising number of unconfirmed transactions. Gulf Stream functions by pushing transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network. Since every validator knows the order of upcoming leaders (block producers) in Solana architecture, clients and validators forward transactions to the expected leader ahead of time. This allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, reduce confirmation times, switch leaders faster, and reduce the memory pressure on validators from the unconfirmed transaction pool. One consequence of knowing leaders ahead of time is an increased risk of validator collusion since the network allows more time for them to coordinate. Solana's fast block times might mitigate the opportunity for collusion because it limits the time allowed to plan an attack. 

Sealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time
Solana built Sealevel, a hyper parallelized transaction processing engine designed to scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs. Most other blockchains are single-threaded computers. In contrast, Solana can support parallel transaction execution (in addition to signature verification) in a single shard. The solution to this problem borrows heavily from an operating system driver technique called scatter-gather. Transactions specify upfront what state they will read and write while executing. Sealevel is able to find the non-overlapping transactions occurring in a block and execute them in parallel (called parallel execution) while optimizing how read and writes to the state are scheduled across an array of RAID 0 SSDs. Sealevel is a VM that schedules transactions, but it doesn’t actually execute transactions in the VM. Instead, Sealevel hands off transactions to be executed on hardware natively using bytecode called the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).

Pipeline: A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization
The process of transaction validation on the Solana network makes extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining. Pipelining is an appropriate process when there’s a stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps and there’s different hardware responsible for each step. On the Solana network, the pipeline mechanism, the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), progresses through Data Fetching at the kernel level, Signature Verification at the GPU level, Banking at the CPU level, and Writing at the kernel space. By the time the TPU starts to send blocks out to the validators, it’s already fetched in the next set of packets, verified their signatures, and begun crediting tokens. The GPU parallelization in this four-stage pipeline allows the Solana TPU to operate at a high performance.

Cloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database
Methods to scale computation using these other innovations could result in memory bottlenecks. Memory is used to keep track of accounts and can struggle to maintain performance due to a lack of memory size and limited access speeds. Cloudbreak was designed to optimize for concurrent reads and writes spread across a RAID 0 configuration of SSDs. Each additional disk adds storage capacity available to on-chain programs, while also increasing the number of concurrent reads and writes programs can perform when executing. This goes hand in hand with Solana’s transaction design, allowing for pre-fetching accounts from disk and preparing the runtime for execution, also enabling nodes on the network to begin executing transactions before they are encoded into a block. All of this aims to help reduces block times and confirmation latency on the network.

Archivers: Distributed ledger storage
Storing and maintaining data on a high-performance network is likely to become a primary centralization vector. If storage costs are very high, only well-funded entities will be able to act as validators and participate in consensus. On Solana, data storage is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes called Archivers. Archivers do not participate in consensus. The history of the state is broken into many pieces and erasure codes. Archivers store small parts of the state. Every so often, the network will ask the Archivers to prove that they’re storing the data they are supposed to. Solana leverages Proofs of Replication (PoRep), which are borrowed heavily from Filecoin. Archivers are not currently implemented and are on the long term roadmap. They will be rolled out based on network data demands.",

background: {
background_details: "Launched in October 2018, USD Coin (USDC) is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin by the CENTRE consortium, a partnership between Circle and Coinbase created to develop price-stable crypto assets and network protocols. 

Similar to its predecessors, USDC exists to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. The project was launched out of the insight that the industry needed a fiat-collateralized stablecoin with strong governance and transparency, in contrast to <a href="https://messari.io/asset/tether">Tether</a>. USDC attempts to solve these issues by publishing a monthly public attestation of 100% reserves of fiat tokens on CENTRE.io, and providing clear rules and guidelines for CENTRE members regarding USDC issuance and redemption. Furthermore to become an issuer within the CENTRE consortium members must follow key membership and operating rules which include licensing, compliance, technology & operations, accounting, and custody of fiat reserves.

Exchanges have been the primary users of USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies, outsourcing the need to maintain banking relationships. Furthermore, USDC is one of the only fiat-collateralized stablecoins available for use in the burgeoning <a href="https://messari.io/article/decentralized-finance-defi">DeFi</a> ecosystem.",

technology_details: "USD Coin is the first implementation of CENTRE's fiat-back stablecoin network, launched as an ERC-20 compliant token on Ethereum. USDC relies on a proof-of-reserves system to ensure that reserve assets match circulating tokens. 

CENTRE contracts manage the minting and the redemption/burning of stablecoins, which can be used for both the exchange and wallet interoperability use cases. Customers who on-board through a stablecoin on-ramp, such as a web application created and maintained by a licensed CENTRE token-issuing member, can transfer fiat funds into that CENTRE issuer’s account. The issuer then executes a series of commands with the CENTRE network to verify, mint, and validate fiat tokens pegged to the value of those deposited funds. The customer can then transfer those tokens elsewhere in order to use them. Redemption follows the reverse sequence: fiat tokens are burned when a customer visits an off-ramp such as a web application maintained by a licensed CENTRE issuing member. Upon successful verification and validation, funds from underlying fiat reserves would be transferred to the customer’s external bank.

Members issue tokens when users deposit fiat currency into CENTRE member bank accounts while CENTRE members destroy tokens when users redeem tokens for fiat currency deposits in CENTRE member bank accounts. In order to prove that reserves exist and the system is solvent, USDC relies on a proof-of-reserves system whereby the system is fully collateralized when the number of USDC in circulation matches the value of the funds held in accounts operated by CENTRE members. CENTRE published monthly reports with attestations from Grant Thornton LLP proving the US dollar reserves that back the USDC tokens in circulation.

background_details: "Dogecoin is a meme cryptocurrency with the internet-famous Shiba Inu canine breed as a mascot. The project was introduced on Twitter by Jackson Palmer on November 27, 2013 when he tweeted about "investing" on “Dogecoin”, a made-up name. Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, "Unsubshibing. Peace."

Unlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability. ",

New blocks are added to the chain every 60 seconds, on average. 

Dogecoin uses scrypt hash function for its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The scrypt algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale, custom-hardware attacks. At launch, Dogecoin was mine-able on personal computers, which was attractive to cryptocurrency enthusiasts during a time when Bitcoin mining was increasingly industrialized and capital intensive. 

Dogecoin has no formal white paper, although several fans have written blog and forum posts as stand-in explainer documents. ",

background: {
background_details: "Cardano is an open-source blockchain originating from peer-reviewed academic research. Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano sees itself as a “third-generation” protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. 

Cardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. 

Cardano's full launch will consist of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The Byron era arrived in September 2017 with the mainnet launch of the Cardano blockchain. During this phase, the chain operated as a federated network that only supported ADA transactions. The next phase, Shelley, launched in July 2020, bringing Cardano's proposed Ouroboros Proas Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to life. It's now in the process of rolling out its third phase, Goguen, which will add support for smart contracts and native token issuance. Cardano development teams, IOHK and Emurgo, are researching and building the network's remaining phases, Basho and Voltaire, in parallel with Goguen.",

{
title: "Byron (Federated Mainnet)",
date: "2017-09-29T04:00:00Z",
type: "Mainnet Launch",
details: "The Byron era marked the first iteration of the Cardano network. It allowed users to buy, sell, and transaction its native cryptocurrency, ADA, across the protocol. The Byron chain ran on a purpose-built consensus layer, called Ouroboro Genesis, which operated as a federated network with the majority of the node managed by the Cardano Foundation. Therefore, any block rewards generated during this initial phase were burned (no inflation during Byron). 

The Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet, IOHK's official desktop wallet for ADA, as well as Yoroi, a light wallet built by Emurgo for quick transactions and day-to-day use."
},
{
title: "Shelley (Proof-of-Stake)",
date: "2020-07-29T04:00:00Z",
type: "Hard Fork",
details: "Shelley will introduce the Cardano's proposed Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus layer, enabling users to contribute to the transaction validation process either directly or via delegation, in exchange for staking rewards. The upgrade also marks a notable step forward on the path towards decentralization as the current mainnet operated as a federated network managed primarily by the Cardano Foundation.

The a href="https://messari.io/article/cardano-announces-the-prospective-launch-plan-for-cardano-s-shelley-and-ada-staking-rewards"full rollout of Shelley/a could take a month to reach completion. Cardano plans to release a Shelley mainnet candidate chain around Jun. 23 before releasing the code to mainnet on the Jun. 30 target date. The official hard fork that will activate Shelley’s changes could arrive on Jul. 29, which would give network participants enough time to upgrade their nodes and wallets. According to the roadmap, Cardano will begin paying out staking rewards around Aug. 18."
},
{
title: "Goguen (Smart Contracts)",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "The Goguen era will add smart contract functionality, giving developers the ability to build decentralized applications (dApps) on Cardano. DApp development will occur through Cardano's purpose-built smart contract language, Plutus, which makes use of the functional programming language Haskell. Goguen will also introduce Marlowe, a domain-specific language (DSL) for financial contracts built on Plutus. Marlowe and Plutus combined will enable developers to create Cardano-based tokens, such as native fungible or non-fungible tokens or the tokenization of external digital or physical assets (e.g., equity, commodities, real estates, etc.)."
},
{
title: "Basho (Scaling)",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "The Basho era will aim to optimize the network for scalability and interoperability. The goal is to improve the underlying performance of Cardano to better support growth and adoption for applications that require high transaction volumes.

Two of the primary developments proposed for the Bash era are sidechains and parallel accounting styles. Sidechains are new blockchains (like shard chains) that interoperate with the main chain. They can help off-load work from this base layer to increase the overall capacity of the network (scalability through parallel computation). While Cardano uses a UTXO model, sidechains will also have the ability to support account-based models. By having parallel accounting styles, Cardano might be able to interoperate with external networks more easily or support new kinds of uses cases."
},
{
title: "Voltaire (On-chain governance and treasury)",
date: null,
type: "Network Change",
details: "The Voltaire era will introduce Cardano's proposed on-chain governance and treasury system. Participants will be able to use their staked ADA to voting on the future direction of the network.

Upon the launch of Voltaire, protocol improvement proposals will originate from community participants instead of solely through the management of IOHK and Emurgo. Token holders, either through direct staking or a delegation system, will then be able to vote on which proposals the network should implement. Voltaire will also see the addition of a treasury system, whereby a fraction of all transaction fees will be pooled to provide funds for development activities undertaken following the voting process."

Ouroboros consensus aims for improved network security and modularized design. Cardano’s modularization allows for network delegation, sidechains, and light client data structures.

Ouroboros design
Ouroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with a sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. Cardano believes this design is scalable since the network can increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.",

The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) serves to settle transactions made by peers in the network with ADA, Cardano’s native currency. The Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) is optimized to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. 

Cardano developers chose a layered protocol to increase the network’s capacity for protocol changes and soft fork implementations. Cardano is developed in Haskell and Cardano smart contracts are created in Plutus, another programming language that allows for building stricter contracts.",

The project plans to introduce this system upon the arrival of the "Voltaire" era, alongside the network's decentralized treasury. In Cardano's on-chain governance system, participants will be able to use their staked ADA to voting on the future direction of the network.

Once Voltaire is live, protocol improvement proposals will originate from community participants instead of solely through the management of IOHK and Emurgo. Token holders, either through direct staking or a delegation system, will then be able to vote on which proposals the network should implement. Voltaire will also see the addition of a treasury system, whereby a fraction of all transaction fees will be pooled to provide funds for development activities undertaken following the voting process.",

It features a delegated Proof-of-Stake (<a href="https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake">DPoS</a>) consensus mechanism, a system that offers an increase in performance while maintaining true decentralization and censorship resistance. 

TRON is arguably most famous for its low cost ability to make transactions in comparison to other layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum, though still lags behind in developer adoption to be considered a serious rival yet.",

background: {
background_details: "TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network launched their Mainnet in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent File System, a decentralized peer to peer file sharing network. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

overview: {
technology_details: "The TRON public chain uses highly abstract modularisation. It separates the system into several core modules, including the underlying network, data storage, consensus, transaction actuator, TVM, and application layer interface.

The end result is that this enables, through the DPoS consensus algorithm, a maximum of 2,000 TPS.

The underlying network module is a set of customizable and efficient message response systems, built based on Netty, a high-performance network framework. Network module is separated into two modules: Node discovery is implemented based on the Kademlia algorithm. It meets the requirements of node discovery in decentralized network environments and can defend eclipse and witch attacks by a set of node scoring mechanism. Node communication module uses TCP for data transfer. Based on this, a flexible and extensible message registration response mechanism is designed on the business layer.

Blocks are categorized as solidified and un-solidified block to tap the performance potential of the public chain. It can reduce the limits of the CAP theory of distributed systems and give the most consideration to data availability and consistency.  

Solidified blocks cannot be rolled back. Un-solidified blocks contain the latest transaction data. Full nodes provide data inquiry services for both types of blocks to meet various needs from users.

The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode a TIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the TIP process. If such a decision is made, the TIP will move to the final.

Proposals only support voting for yes, not voting by super representatives means they do not agree with the proposal. Proposals are valid for three days from the time when the proposal was created. During the validity period of the proposal, the super representative can vote on the proposal or cancel the previous vote. If the proposal receives 18 or more super representative votes (2/3 majority) during the validity period, the proposal will pass.

background: {
background_details: "The Chainlink protocol was created in September 2017 and officially launched on mainnet in May 2019. Chainlink aims to solve the oracle problem, an inherent limitation of blockchain networks that prevents them from connecting to external data resources that exist off-chain. Through a decentralized network of independent oracle node operators, Chainlink provides a wide range of decentralized services to smart contracts including Price Feeds (financial market data used to power a large portion of the DeFi economy), verifiable randomness (enabling the creation of dynamic NFTs and fair on-chain gaming applications), proof of reserve (providing proofof off-chain collateral that is backing stablecoins and cross-chain tokens), the Keeper Network (transaction automation bots that provide autonomous DevOps services), and more. 

The recently released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper also broadens the capabilities of Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and describes how the Chainlink Network is evolving to provide both tamper-proof data delivery and secure off-chain computation. Chainlink oracle networks enable the creation of highly scalable and privacy-preserving hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain and off-chain infrastructure. Off-Chain Reporting, a recent scalability upgrade of the Chainlink Network that lowered the gas costs of oracle updates by 90%, represents the first move towards achieving the goals laid out in the whitepaper.",

Failure to provide adequate oracle services would result in a node operator's LINK being deducted.

Chainlink is not a monolithic network like a blockchain but rather an infrastructure and framework for building blockchain-agnostic oracle networks that augment the capabilities of blockchains and layer-2 protocols.

Each Chainlink oracle network consists of multiple independent oracle nodes that fetch data from multiple independent data providers, aggregate the data into a single data point, and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by smart contracts. Chainlink's flexible architecture allows for highly configurable oracle networks that can be composed of any selection of node operators and data providers and that use different network parameters such as update frequency, fee payment amounts, and more.

Chainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps infrastructure providers, leading enterprises, and premium data providers who supply smart contracts with access to cryptographically signed data for additional security guarantees. Because of its flexible design, Chainlink can provide any type of data or computation to any smart contract application operating on any blockchain network.",

background: {
background_details: "Avalanche was first conceptualized and shared on InterPlanetary File System (aka IPFS) in May 2018 by a pseudonymous group of enthusiasts named "Team Rocket." Later it was developed by a dedicated team of researchers from Cornell University. The research was led by Emin Gün Sirer, a professor of computer science and software engineer, assisted by doctoral students Maofan "Ted" Yin and Kevin Sekniqi. Following the research stage, Ava Labs was founded to develop the network primarily to meet complex financial industry requirements. In March 2020, the AVA codebase for the Avalanche consensus protocol became open-source and available to the public.   

In addition to meeting complex financial industry requirements, Avalanche targets three broad use cases:

– Building application-specific blockchains, spanning permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) deployments.
– Building and launching highly scalable and decentralized applications (Dapps).
– Building arbitrarily complex digital assets with custom rules, covenants, and riders (smart assets).

Avalanche's Initial Coin Offering ended on July 15, 2020, followed by the launch of mainnet in September of the same year. In September 2020, the protocol also issued the native token AVAX (an acronym for "Avalanche"). Ultimately, Avalanche is designed to be a high-performing, scalable, customizable, and secure blockchain platform.",

consensus: {
consensus_details: "Avalanche utilizes a DAG-optimized novel family of Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols collectively called Snow. The family consists of three components – Slush, Snowflake, and Snowball. Snowflake and Snowball are leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols built around Slush, a non-BFT metastable mechanism. Inspired by gossip algorithms, consensus gains its properties through the metastable mechanism whereby the system operates by repeatedly sampling the network at random and steering correct nodes towards a common outcome. 

The metastable mechanism aims to quickly move a large network to an irreversible state, where the irreversibility implies that a sufficiently large portion of the network has accepted a proposal, and a conflicting proposal will not be accepted with any higher than negligible probability. 

In simple terms, Avalanche's consensus is leaderless by design. Transactions are verified by having nodes communicate with each other at random until a sufficiently large portion of them reach an agreement. A validator's chance of being sampled is proportional to their AVAX stake. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of validators. The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX. Avalanche's leaderless design allows it to waive slashing penalties, which can otherwise act as a deterrent to prospective stakers. Ultimately, this approach is aimed at maximizing its total validator set.

Further, because Avalanche is a lightweight protocol, the minimum computer requirements are quite modest and do not require special computer hardware.

· Hardware: 8 core CPU   = 2 GHz, RAM: 16 GB, Storage: 200 GB free space.
· OS: Ubuntu   = 18.04 or Mac OS X   = Catalina. (Ubuntu versions older than 18.04 may work but have not been tested.)
· Network: IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port, capable of at least 30Mbps throughput.

Requirements scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node. A large node (100k+ AVAX staked) gets the most significant instance to ensure the node doesn't fall behind and jeopardize staking rewards. A small node (less than 10k AVAX staked) can run a healthy node on a below-spec computer.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, scalable ecosystem. Avalanche uses Proof-of-Stake, allowing validators to have a first-hand say in the system while consuming minimal energy. Avalanche is not a single chain network. It features multiple chains, with some performing core functions while others are more application-specific. All non-core Avalanche chains (called subnets) must rely on validators that stake AVAX on one of Avalanche’s central platforms. Validators must be a member of the Primary Network; all other subnets are optional. The Primary Network contains three blockchains: 

Platform Chain (P-Chain) 
Contract Chain (C-Chain) 
Exchange Chain (X-Chain) 

All three combine to provide the same capabilities of a single network. The X-Chain handles the creation of new digital assets and the exchange of tokens between the core blockchains and their various subnets. The C-Chain is an instance of Ethereum’s EVM, which allows for the creation and execution of Solidity-based applications. The last chain, known as the P-Chain, is the base staking platform that manages network validators and enables developers to create new subnets. Every validator must stake on the P-Chain and participate in securing Avalanche’s Primary Network.",

The Stellar blockchain allows anyone to issue new assets in the network and exchange for other assets via built-in asset exchange features. Assets on Stellar are issued and redeemed by anchors, who are trusted entities that issue digital credits on the Stellar network in exchange for deposits of the asset with the trusted entity. Anchors enable real world assets to be exchanged on Stellar by leveraging a <a href="https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges">distributed exchange</a> that maintains an order book for every asset pair. Stellar supports the issuance of any type of asset including stocks, currencies, cryptoassets and more.

background: {
background_details: "After leaving <a href="https://messari.io/organization/ripple">Ripple</a> in 2013 due to internal conflicts over vision, <a href="https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb">Jed McCaleb</a>, along with partner Joyce Kim, forked the Ripple protocol and launched the Stellar project in 2014. With the creation of the non-for profit <a href="https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation">Stellar Development Foundation</a> (SDF), the team aimed to "promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services." The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. 

In 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called "Stellar Consensus Protocol" was developed by Stanford professor <a href="https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res">David Mazières</a>, chief scientist of the SDF. In 2017, Jed McCaleb and Brit Yonge launched <a href="https://messari.io/organization/interstellar">Lightyear</a> as a for-profit entity of Stellar, that would build a universal payment network on Stellar. In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.

In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.

In November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation <a href="https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus">announced</a> it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs. Previously the foundation had retained 68 billion XLM earmarked for giveaways in order to grow the community. Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.

In order to restore the ledger to its expected number of coins, the Stellar Foundation burned Lumens using one of the bugs fixed in this release, practically speaking this ended up being equivalent to a forced distribution of Lumens by the foundation.

50% would be reserved for the Direct Sign-up Program. The goal of the Direct Sign-up Program was "to make lumens easily accessible to millions of individuals and communities across the globe" through airdrops.
20% would be allocated to the Bitcoin Program. The goal of the Bitcoin Program was "to encourage bitcoin holders to explore and use Stellar" by airdropping tokens to Bitcoin addresses. 
25% would be distributed as part of the Partnership Program. The goal of the Partnership Program was "to encourage adoption and growth of Stellar through the institutional distribution of lumens" by distributing grants to businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations.
2% would be allocated to Stripe for its seed investment and locked until June 2019.
3% would be retained by the Stellar Development Foundation for its operational budget

The Direct Sign-up, Bitcoin and Partnership Program featured an initial distribution plan over a period of 10 years. Nevertheless, the SDF did not manage to distribute those XLM as expected and conducted several changes to its distribution plan and treasury management over the years, as detailed in the Supply Curve details section.

supply_curve_details: "As detailed in the launch section, the Stellar Development Foundation initially designed a distribution schedule that would help grow the number of XLM holders by airdropping the supply initially issued (100 billion XLM) to specific groups. Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:
Out of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in October 2016 and August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. 
Out of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. 
Out of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. 

Globally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. 

Built-in Inflation Mechanism

Until October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.

2017 Inflation Exploit

From January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, <a href="https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit">discovered in 2019 by Messari</a>. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.

Overhang burning

Conscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.
37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). 
12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. 
4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. 

Through this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM. ",

consensus: {
consensus_details: "Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is a modified version of Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). In an FBA system, there are quorums and quorum slices. Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). 

Consensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.

SCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.

overview: {
technology_details: "The Stellar blockchain consensus mechanism is called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), an implementation of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.

An FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on “quorum slices” to reach consensus—subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the “slice.” Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.

To attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network’s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.

Some of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.

The Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors. ",

governance: {
governance_details: "Stellar is an open source source protocol whereby anyone can review and contribute to the development of Stellar's core code. New changes or standards start as proposals divided into two categories: Core Advancement Proposals and Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. Core Advancement Proposals (CAPs) are suggested changes to the core protocol of Stellar. Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) deal with changes to the standards, protocols, and methods used in the ecosystem built on top of the Stellar network. Ultimately protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when they are accepted by a majority of the network validators. 

Nevertheless, despite independent contribution to the project through CAPs and SEPs, a full-time team at the SDF performs the majority of protocol and ecosystem development. The SDF sets the project roadmap, acts as a steward of the Stellar network, and builds constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions worldwide. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Stellar. SDF was created in collaboration with Stripe, which provided $3 million in seed funding, and is financed by Stellar Lumens. SDF has three boards: the Board of Directors, responsible for governance decisions and XLM distribution; the Architecture Board, responsible for technical initiatives; and the Expansion Board, responsible for ecosystem growth and regulatory issues.

Ether is not compatible with the ERC-20 standard, meaning a direct exchange from ETH to ERC-20 tokens without the use of centralized third parties is not possible. WETH is an ERC-20 token generated by depositing ETH into a smart contract at a 1:1 ratio. Once ETH has been "wrapped" into WETH, it can then be used across any dApp supporting the ERC-20 token standard in the Ethereum network.  WETH can be exchanged for ETH or the other way around at any time by interacting with the smart contract originally used to "wrap" the token.",

background: {
background_details: "As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around <a href="https://messari.io/resource/block-size">block size</a> began. However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.

In 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support <a href="https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness">SegWit</a> and a 2MB <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork">hard fork</a>. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would <a href="https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork">soft fork</a> to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. 

Although increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full <a href="https://messari.io/resource/node">nodes</a>, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has also had a variety of upgrades, the most recent of which taking place of 05/15/2021. This upgrade made a variety of changes including the removal of the unconfirmed transaction limit, the enabling multiple OP_RETURNS, the implementation of double-spend proofs, , the inclusion of Cash Improvement Proposals (CHIPs) to introduce new specification changes to the protocol, and the inclusion of a new mining block default limit size of 8 MB.

supply_curve_details: "Bitcoin Cash shares <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>'s genesis block and entire blockchain history up to August 01, 2019 (block 478559) when the hard fork occurred. As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are <a href="https://messari.io/resource/halving">halved </a>every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.

The difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm.

consensus_details: "Consensus

Bitcoin Cash uses <a href="https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus">Nakamoto Consensus</a> whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a>. Consensus in Bitcoin Cash, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.

Mining

Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a <a href="https://messari.io/resource/sha-256">SHA-256</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hash</a> less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Notably, the target difficulty level is adjusted every block as opposed to Bitcoin's every 2016 blocks.

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Bitcoin Cash mining is now dominated by <a href="https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASICs</a> usually situated in enterprise-scale data centers. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Bitcoin Cash, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 32MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href="https://messari.io/resource/mempool">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka "full nodes") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.

Mining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty</a> adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin Cash uses a <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain.

governance_details: "Bitcoin Cash developement is open to the open-source community. Although largely driven by Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Cash has 6 different client implementations. Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin Cash community can submit draft proposals. After debate by the community, the client implementation editors accept or reject the proposals. Decisions from the process are written into the Bitcoin Cash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus. 

Although very similar to Bitcoin overall, as opposed to users signaling support of upgrades, Bitcoin Cash tends to use hash power signaling to indicate support of network upgrades. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash implements planned upgrades on a bi-annual basis as part of its more progressive network upgrade philosophy",

While efforts are being made, there is no certainty that Bitfinex will be able to recover the funds. To alleviate the cash shortfall, BitFinex announced it would conduct a private offering for $1 billion for it's token Unus Sed Leo. 

The token will be used to receive discounts on trading on current and future iFinex trading platforms and services. iFinex will buy back tokens from the market with a minimum of 27% of consolidated revenues from the previous month until all tokens are removed from circulation. In addition, an amount equal to 95% of the recovered net funds from Crypto Capital and 80% of recovered funds from a 2016 hack will be used to repurchase outstanding tokens. ",

project_details: "Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger of transactions, otherwise known as a <a href="https://messari.io/article/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt">DLT</a> (distributed ledger technology). While blockchains are the most commonly used DLTs, Hedera is slightly different since it uses a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph. The hashgraph consensus algorithm aims to process and finalize more transactions at scale than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, as they are often characterized by high latency and low transactions per second (tps). Hedera's state is stored on mainnet nodes, which are all currently run by members of the Hedera Governing Council. But in the future, mainnet nodes will be permissionless. These nodes secure the Hedera ledger by reaching a consensus on the validity and order of transactions.

Hedera provides two core network services: the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and the Hedera Token Service (HTS). HCS allows clients to submit messages to the Hedera network for consensus timestamping and ordering, but it doesn't require the consensus nodes to store state related to that message. Instead, application state or data is persisted off-chain, where HCS users can define confidentiality and access control that cater to their use-case. The HTS supports native tokenization, whereby clients can create and manage various token types. Token controls include managing supply and KYC compliance, along with native atomic swaps and multi-sig capabilities.",

background: {
background_details: "Hedera Hashgraph Vision
Hashgraph is a relatively new consensus protocol that aims to process transactions faster than existing networks. Hedera layers Proof-of-Stake for consensus weighting, a fee & rewards model, a cryptocurrency, and the two key HCS and HTS services on top of hashgraph, Hedera's consensus algorithm. Since hashgraph has the potential to process transactions at a comparatively efficient rate, Hedera intends to be a platform that can support high-volume use cases, such as micropayments, data integrity, and tokenization. The network also supports a virtual machine that can compile smart contracts written in Solidity, similar to the EVM. Hedera intends to be compliant across jurisdictions by offering native support for optional KYC and AML checks via its "Verified Identity" mechanism.

Hedera will launch in a permissioned model with only the governing members running nodes. Over time, as the distribution of the network's native token, HBAR, improves, the node membership will transition from permissioned to fully permissionless, where any network participant can operator a Hedera consensus node.

Entities Behind the Network
Hedera Hashgraph LLC is a US-based entity that is governed by 39 term-limited global enterprises across multiple industries. These entities manage Hedera's consensus nodes while collaborating to determine the protocol's future direction (i.e., Hedera's near-term governance model). Governing members are responsible for council membership, regulating network rules and tokens, and approving changes to the protocol. They also elect subcommittees that will operate traditional corporate functions such as Legal, Finance, and Marketing departments. Governing members receive fees from operating nodes to compensate for their security and governance contributions, but they do not take profits from the entity in their role as members.

Swirlds is a separate company that owns the intellectual property of the hashgraph consensus algorithm and is an equal-weight governing member. Swirlds has licensed the technology to Hedera Hashgraph. The two entities will use the associated patent rights to legally prohibit anyone from forking the code and creating a competing platform and currency. While the consensus algorithm is not open source, it is "open review," meaning anyone can verify there are no backdoors in the code. Additionally, Hedera's platform and services code, as well as developer tools, are all open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Using GitHub developers can make a "Hedera Improvement Proposal" (HIP) which members of the community can vote on.",

The exchange rate between the two is updated hourly to give clients stability in prices irrespective of fluctuation in HBAR price.
Network Security via Staking: A node's influence towards the determination of consensus timestamp and order is weighted by the number of HBARs the node itself has in its account and (to be implemented at a future date) the number of HBARs that other non-node accounts proxy to that node.
Incentivizing Security (Staking Rewards): Nodes (and those that proxy their HBARs to nodes) will receive daily reward payments as per the participation in validating transactions during that period."

launch_style: "Private Sale",
launch_details: "Initial Allocations
Hedera network has a total fixed supply of 50 billion HBAR, which were minted at the network launch on Aug. 24, 2018. Before the Hedera network opened to the public, 6.7 million HBAR were set aside for the community testing program, while the rest remained in the Hedera Treasury account. When the network opened access to the public on Sept. 16, 2019, 45.09% of the total 50 billion HBAR were allocated to early management, employees (current and future), SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) investors, advisors, community earn programs, and enterprise and developer grants. The rest (54.91%) remained in the Hedera Treasury.

Private SAFTs
Hedera issued three SAFTs, with the first SAFT being offered in December 2017 and the final SAFT round closing in August 2018. In the aggregate, 17.45% of all HBAR were sold in these private rounds. Hedera’s co-founders and early executives also acquired tokens through a SAFT as part of their compensation. Dr. Baird and Mr. Harmon (“The Founders”) each have a coin grant of two billion HBAR in total allocation (4% of total supply), each vesting over six years. Other senior executives who joined Hedera prior to March 2018 received an aggregate of 3.5% of the total coin supply via SAFTs and coin grants.

Additional Allocations
Hedera compensated employees, advisors, vendors, and other service providers in the form of Restricted Coin Units (RCUs), whereby individuals vest into a right to receive a select amount of HBAR. Hedera created a reserve of 8.1 billion HBAR for the coin plan that covers RCUs.

Hedera issued Swirlds (which owns patents on the hashgraph technology) a one-time allocation of 5% of the total supply of HBAR and allocated 1.24 billion tokens to the developer community and ecosystem reserve funds.

No more than 34% of the total HBAR is expected to be released until 2025.

Hedera will remain a permissioned network until the total value of all the circulating HBAR is high enough to be prohibitively expensive for a malicious user (or group of users) to acquire enough tokens to conduct an attack."

details: "SAFT Series 1 was offered to employees, other early contributors and advisors, friends, and family in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “*Securities Act*”). Under SAFT Series 1, Hedera raised $4.7 million from 40 purchasers. The original price per coin was $1.00, based on an original total supply of 50 million coins. After Amendment No. 1, the adjusted purchase price was $0.001 per coin. Hedera sold 4.9 billion coins (split-adjusted) through SAFT Series 1, which represents 56% of all coins sold via SAFTs and 9.8% of the total coin supply. The SAFT Series 1 offering commenced in December 2017 and final investment forms were received by January 2018.

The original terms for coin release provided that 20% of the coins would be released upon Network Launch, and 20% on each of the subsequent four anniversaries of Network Launch.  Amendment No. 1 changed the distribution schedule to provide that the initial 20% would not be released until at least six months after Network Launch.  Following two additional amendments approved by the holders of SAFT Series 1 in August 2019 and October 2019, coins from SAFT Series 1 are being released to purchasers on a more gradual basis to better align with expected network growth: 2% were released to SAFT Series 1 purchasers on the date of Open Access, 2% were released in the seven days following Open Access, and the remainder of the coins are being released at least quarterly, over a period that ends in September 2023.

To fund the Hedera platform’s development and the network’s initial operations, Hedera accepted investments in the form of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (“SAFTs”). Overall, Hedera raised $124 million via SAFTs. The SAFTs were offered at a fixed price per token, not a discount to a future sale price. The initial two rounds of SAFTs have long release schedules of three to four years, while the final SAFT round offered a choice between a four-year release schedule and an eight-month release schedule. The first two SAFT seed rounds were at a price of close to zero dollars. The third SAFT was available with two pricing options and different release schedules, either 12 cents for a release schedule over 8 months or 9.6 cents for a 4-year release. 

The maximum outstanding supply (50,000,000,000 HBARs) was minted at launch.
It is allocated as follows:

Hedera Treasury - 32.4% - Majority approval of council members is required prior to distribution.

Ecosystem Development - 24.0% - To accelerate development of the Hedera ecosystem.

Purchase Agreements - 17.4% - Prior sale of Hedera tokens via Simple Agreement for Future Tokens ("SAFTs") will be distributed to investors according to lock-up agreements.

Founders & Early Execs - 13.8% - Given to Mance Harmon and Leemon Baird, and early senior executives. 

Swirlds - 8.0% - Allocated to pay license fees and for Swirlds' investors.

consensus: {
consensus_details: "The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is used for consensus on the Hedera Mainnet. The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT). Every node participates in every round of consensus, meaning it doesn't rely on a single node or "leader" to order transactions each round. The consensus is ''fair in that it doesn’t allow a leader to censor or unduly delay a given transaction.

In addition to ordering transactions, Hashgraph also issues a consensus timestamp for each transaction, calculated as the time at which the transaction reached a majority of the network. Once the consensus timestamp is determined then the transaction is final, which contrasts most Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks that rely on probabilistic finality. A formal proof of the consensus algorithm is available here. Hedera's fee model is not auction-based, a common model among most networks for submitting transactions. Without the concept of a fee auction, users can't pay more in fees to increase the likelihood of their transactions being ordered before transactions that may have been submitted earlier.

Hashgraph aims to process a high number of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency. The team has said Hedera's hashgraph consensus allows it to support over 10,000 transactions per second. The nature of these transactions has been disputed, as the 10,000 number may only represent cryptocurrency transactions and not any smart contract interactions. These disputes can be found here and here, while the Hedera team has issued a few rebuttals here and here.

As for how Hedera achieves this reportedly high TPS, it leverages two core components within Hashgraph: gossip about gossip and virtual voting. These components, along with weighting votes by stake, enable nodes to determine the consensus order of transactions. More information can be found here.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Hashgraph Consensus
Hedera uses hashgraph consensus, an alternative to blockchain consensus mechanisms. It achieves a lower latency on transaction finality because once consensus on the timestamp and order of transactions is reached, those transactions are applied to the state in that order. Hashgraphs attempts to remove the reliance on fee-based auctions for transaction inclusion, which can lead to greater fees when the native token fluctuates in price and the potential for higher levels of MEV (miner extractable value).

Consensus Nodes
Hedera's public ledger being stored and run by the Hedera Governing Council. While running mainnet node is currently limited to Council members, Hedera eventually plans to make its network permissionless, allowing any participant to run a consensus node. Hedera nodes come to consensus on the validity and order of transactions. When the network transitions to a permissionless state, the influence of each node towards consensus will be weighted by the number of HBAR in their account. Hedera will run PoS (Proof-of-Stake) but without any stake bonding or slashing penalties. Hashgraph will function as the consensus and security layer, while the PoS layer will deter DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.

Consensus nodes (currently run by Council members) will receive daily payments to compensate for their bandwidth, storage, and computing costs. These daily payments will be proportional to the stake the nodes have designated. Other accounts that proxy their stake to a node will receive smaller payments to incentivize them to select valid nodes.

Mirror nodes offer a cost-effective way to query historical data without trust loss. The key network services are cryptocurrency, consensus, and token services.

Network Fees
Clients pay fees in HBARs for the network to process a transaction. The network attempts to keep fees low. For instance, transferring HBARs between accounts costs approximately $0.0001 USD according to the team. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. Clients are given stability in fees since the network updates the exchange rate between HBAR and USD every hour to reflect the market price.",

governance: {
governance_details: "Hedera is owned and governed by the Hedera Governing Council, which consists of up to 39 term-limited organizations and enterprises. Council members are committed to running consensus nodes and governing software changes.

Each member of the Hedera Governing Council has an equal vote when deciding whether to accept an improvement proposal or change to the Hedera platform’s codebase. All members have a three-year maximum term, with up to two consecutive terms. Swirlds, the creator of the hashgraph algorithm, has a permanent seat and equal vote. After initial members are selected by Swirlds, the council’s Membership Committee will source replacements.

The Hedera network separates governance from consensus. The governance model is more traditional, using a model pioneered by National BankAmericard Inc. (now VISA) in 1968. It is designed in a way to incentivize the governing council to do what’s in the best interest of the Hedera network and discourage a single company from assuming total control. It also aims to prevent the Hedera Governing Council from being unduly influenced by individual members or node operators.

The hashgraph consensus algorithm is proprietary but “open review;” therefore, the network and its cryptocurrency cannot be forked by third-party developers, but the underlying code is available to the public for review.

background_details: "Created in October 2011 by ex Google and <a href="https://messari.io/organization/coinbase">Coinbase</a> engineer, <a href="https://messari.io/person/charlie-lee">Charlie Lee</a>, Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin's source code that posits itself as "a silver to Bitcoin's gold."  Technically, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin with key differences relating to block time, supply, <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hashing</a> algorithm, and initial distribution. Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.

Notably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although <a href="https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASICs</a> have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.

Charlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation">Litecoin foundation</a>, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development. ",

Litecoin's first halvings occurred on August 2015 and  August 2019. The next halving will occur in August 2023.

Eventually, once the 84 million LTC hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for LTC.

Consensus in Litecoin, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.

Mining

Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a Scypt algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Similar to Bitcoin, the target difficulty level is adjusted every 2016 blocks; however, due to Litecoin's 2.5 minute block times, Litecoin's difficulty level adjusts more quickly than Bitcoin's.

Litecoin originally implemented the Scrypt algorithm for its memory intensive properties, which made it more resistant to <a href="https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASICs</a>; however, over time Litecoin's ASIC resistant properties have eroded with Scrypt-capable ASICs having been developed. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Litecoin, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 1MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href="https://messari.io/blog/mempool">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka "full nodes") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and <a href="https://messari.io/article/double-spending">double-spend</a> vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.

Mining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Litecoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain.

background: {
background_details: "Monero traces its origins back to <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bytecoin/profile">Bytecoin</a>, the first implementation of CryptoNote, which was an application layer protocol aimed at solving various issues with Bitcoin such as traceability, mining centralization, and irregular coin emission. Bytecoin launched in March 2014; however, after a controversial 80% premine, a Bitcointalk forum user known as thankfulfortoday forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the a new project named BitMonero, a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (meaning "coin" in Esperanto). 

The release of BitMonero was poorly received by the community that initially backed it, leading seven community members to fork BitMonero into a new project called Monero. This largely pseudonymous group, led by Fluffypony (<a href="https://messari.io/person/riccardo-spagni">Riccardo Spagni</a>), ultimately became the first Monero Core team. Monero launched its project in April 2014 with no premine. 

Monero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons. Since its launch Monero has become one of the most widely used darknet currencies in the world due to its anonymity by default features. In 2017 Monero further enhanced its privacy features by incorporating Ring CT signatures, a solution proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, that obscures transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. This provided near complete transaction anonymity in contrast to just sender anonymity as it was previously. In October 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a <a href="https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs">zero-knowledge proof</a> technology that replaced the previous zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions relied on. Bulletproofs cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent, significantly increasing transaction efficiency. 

Monero undergoes scheduled hard forks every six months intended to allow Monero to evolve at a regular cadence, while still leaving users enough time to update before being forked away from the network. These hard forks tend to include everything from patches and bug fixes to hashing algorithm changes and functionality upgrades.

In December 2019, Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), Monero's lead maintainer <a href="https://messari.io/article/monero-s-fluffypony-steps-down">stepped down</a> from the project in an effort to further decentralize the project. ",

Monero uses <a href="https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus">Nakamoto Consensus</a> whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a> (POW). Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href="https://messari.io/blog/hash-function">hash</a> less than the target number set by Monero's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.

In the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. 

Block sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero. ",

overview: {
technology_details: "Monero, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of <a href="https://messari.io/article/utxo">unspent transaction output </a>(UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of dynamic-sized data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href="https://messari.io/article/mempool">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka "full nodes") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.

Mining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Monero's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Monero uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. 

Monero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX, an algorithm using random code execution and memory-hard techniques for ASIC resistance. Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to implement upgrades to the protocol, often times changing its PoW algorithm to prevent ASICs from joining the network.

Monero's privacy enhancements stem from ring signatures, which mask sender identities and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero’s blockchain. Including past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. 

In January 2017, Monero implemented Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) in an effort to combat concerns around the true degree of anonymity offered by Monero. Ring signatures only provided privacy for the sender of the transaction, and required outputs to be broken up into separate rings because ring signatures could only contain outputs of the same value. Ring CT signatures aimed to alleviate these concerns by obscuring transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. With Ring CTs wallets could arbitrarily select ring members from any output size. To prove that certain amounts were spent, Ring CTs used range proofs, a <a href="https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs">zero knowledge cryptography</a> technique used to prove the amount used in a transaction with revealing the details. 

However, the range proofs used in Monero's confidential transactions to ensure the integrity of transactions, were computationally intensive, leading the Monero blockchain to bloat due to the onerous data requirements of each transaction. Thus, in October 2018 Monero implemented bulletproofs, which addressed this scalability issue, cutting the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent and significantly increasing transaction efficiency. Bulletproofs are a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that does not require a trusted setup. Bulletproofs aggregate information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly, allowing even greater scaling for larger transactions that contain multiple outputs.",

governance: {
governance_details: "Monero protocol development involves a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Monero community can submit proposals for improving the Monero protocol. After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Monero Core maintainers merge code changes into Monero Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Monero Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.

Monero funds protocol development through its Forum Funding System (FFS), a donation based crowdfunding system. The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work. Once proposals have been funded, funds are released as certain milestones are reached.    

Monero opts for scheduled hard forks every six months. The community believes that not only does this ensure the protocol is continuously being improved at a regular cadence, but it also keeps the community engaged in the governance process. ",

background_details: "Polkadot origins
Polkadot is the brainchild of Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the inventor of the Solidity smart contract language. Dr. Wood started working on his idea to “design a sharded version of Ethereum” in mid-2016 and released the first draft of the Polkadot white paper in Oct. 2016.

In 2017, Dr. Wood and Parity’s Peter Czaban founded the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit entity established to support the research and development of Polkadot as well as to oversee its fundraising efforts. The Switzerland-based Web3 Foundation hosted Polkadot’s first token sale in Oct. 2017, using a Spend-All Second Price Dutch Auction to distribute the funds. The sale raised $145 million in just under two weeks, selling 50% of the initial 10 million DOT (old) supply, and the Web3 Foundation chose Parity Technologies to develop Polkadot.

Parity Technologies was founded by Dr. Wood and Jutta Steiner and is known for maintaining the Parity Ethereum client in addition to Substrate, which serves as the development framework for Polkadot.

Parity Wallet hack and subsequent fundraising efforts
Ten days after the token sale ended (Nov. 6, 2017), someone permanently froze the funds in the Parity multisig contract (the second such incident in a matter of months) compromising a little over $90 million worth of ETH equaling around 66% of Polkadot’s token sale proceeds. Polkadot, along with Parity, has petitioned the Ethereum community to consider finding a way to return to the funds, but the situation remains unresolved. Despite the lost funds, Polkadot and Web3 Foundation reported the project still had enough funds to meet its development milestones.

The Web3 Foundation reportedly raised more capital to replenish the lost funds in a 2019 private token sale. In the sale, Polkadot sought to sell 500,000 DOT (old) tokens at a $1.2 billion valuation, pricing the tokens at $120 apiece. Although the foundation did not disclose any details related to the raise, it was reported that the sale closed in June 2019 at a “successful” valuation.

Polkadot technical developments and mainnet rollout
On the technical front, Polkadot started rolling out various proofs-of-concept (PoCs) in May 2018 to test its base relay chain, the relay chain’s support for parachains, and its finality agent (dubbed GRANDPA). PoC 3, released in Jan. 2019, also introduced the Alexander testnet, Polkadot’s first test network. But the project’s first significant release came in Aug. 2019 with the public launch of Kusama. Kusama is an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot, designed to serve as a "canary" network for Polkadot to test governance, staking, and sharding under real economic conditions. Polkadot also dedicated 1% of the initial DOT supply to Kusama stakeholders in order to encourage participation.

Polkadot adopted a staged rollout strategy for its mainnet launch. Polkadot's first mainnet chain candidate, Phase 1, launched on <a href="https://messari.io/article/polkadot-goes-live-with-the-release-of-its-first-mainnet-chain-candidate">May 27, 2020</a>. It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operated as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. Eventually, the network transitioned to its proposed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system on Jun. 18, 2020 (Phase 2), which enabled DOT owners to claim validators slots and unlocked staking rewards. Phases 3 and 4 in late Jul. 2020 introduced Polkadot's governance functionality and handing control of the protocol over to the community, respectively. The final phase plans to unlock DOT token transfers on Aug. 18, 2020.

The Web3 Foundation continues to use the proceeds from DOT sales to fund ecosystem initiatives and back projects building on Polkadot (see: the <a href="https://messari.io/article/polychain-web3-foundation-start-a-fund-to-back-projects-building-on-polkadot">Polkadot Ecosystem Fund</a>). The foundation is governed by the Foundation Council, a governing body consisting of Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.

DOT redenomination
In the first official community vote for the network, Polkadot token holders voted to change the denomination between DOT and its smallest unit, Plancks, by a factor of 100. This change officially went into effect at block #1,248,328, which arrived on Aug. 21, 2020, about 72 hours after DOT transfers unlocked at block #1,205,128  (Aug. 18, 2020).

It was a cosmetic change that was similar to a stock split. The token balances of each Polkadot account increased by 100x, increasing the total DOT supply from its original 10 million to 1 billion. But the move did not impact Polkadot’s pre-market valuation as the dollar amount of each DOT will decrease by 100x.",

This move gave the newly elected 13-member Council and DOT token holders the ability to propose and vote on protocol improvements or changes. Polkadot also has a three-member Technical Committee, with two seats held by the Parity and another one managed by the Web3 Foundation. Technical Committee members can carry out protocol changes quickly should a network issue arise. But this proposal must be officially approved by an accelerated Council vote before upgrading.

Most believe that the first action taken by the Council would be to remove the Sudo privileges from the Web3 Foundation and hand power over the protocol to the Council and the token holder community."

This Sudo ability allowed the Foundation to manage the chain and initiate runtime upgrades during Polkadot's early phases, such as when the network converted to its Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) protocol. With the removal of these admin keys, Polkadot has now transitioned from a candidate chain to its official mainnet and no longer operates similarly to a permissioned network.

The network's future direction is now in the hands of its on-chain governance system, a three-chamber model consisting of a Council, a Technical Committee, and DOT token holders.

token_usage_details: "The DOT token is Polkadot’s native token. It serves four functions: payment for fees, governance over the network, interoperability, and bonding. When messages are sent between two blockchains on the network, DOT's are used to pay for fees. DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.

How to stake DOTs
While validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network’s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network’s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.

Polkadot Wallet
There are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch. Most notably, blockchain.com announced that it will integrate DOT tokens into its wallet allowing users to store, send and receive tokens as well as participate in governance by voting on proposals."

launch_style: "Crowdsale",
launch_details: "In Oct. 2017, the Web 3.0 Foundation raised the equivalent of $145 million in ether (ETH) through a token sale. The sale was split between a private sale, which raised over $80 million, and a public sale, which raised the remainder. Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. 

At the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:

50% allocated to token sale investors
5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors
3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors
11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts
30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.

The total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (<a href="https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake">PoS</a>) system. 

On Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.

In Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors. Based on previous reports from Polkadot, the project was seeking to raise $60 million at a $1.2 billion valuation through this token sale. The Jun. 2019 announcement declared the raise successful, implying the Polkadot reached its target."

consensus: {
consensus_details: "Polkadot uses what it calls a hybrid consensus, which separates finality from the block production mechanism. At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).

The two mechanisms that power Polkadot’s consensus include:
BABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).
GRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if “more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.”

While the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.

Collator
Each parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a <a href="https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.

Validators
Validators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain’s input queue to the destination parachain’s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.

Nominators
Nominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator’s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.

Fishermen
Fishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Polkadot features a variety of technical components, including the relay-chain, parachains, the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE), and cross-network bridges.

Relay-chain
Polkadot's relay-chain is built with Substrate, a blockchain building framework that is the distillation of Parity technologies learnings building Ethereum, Bitcoin, and enterprise blockchains. It is at the core of the network, helping map addresses to account information, coordinating communications, and providing consensus through a pooled security mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake (PoS). All validators stake their DOTs and produced blocks directly on the relay-chain.

The relay chain lacks features like smart contracts and instead is designed to be a minimal protocol to connect other network participants and provide transaction finality. Since this central chain is handling the bulk of the network’s transaction flows, actions on the relay-chain may come at a premium. But the relay-chain will delegate a significant portion of the computational work to the surrounding parachains, which can have “differing implementations and features.”

Parachains
Parachains will be used to collect and process transactions while using the relay chain for finality. To increase transaction throughput, parachains will process transactions concurrently across multiple chains, instead of queuing transactions and processing them sequentially.

Polkadot does not place any constraints on the design and structure of parachains. These network components can be application-specific or support a particular feature (e.g., privacy or scalability). But each parachain must generate a proof regularly so a designated Polkadot validator can verify and reconcile past transactions. Parachains also share the same state as the relay-chain, meaning if the relay-chain should revert at any point, then all parachains would revert as well. In terms of composability, cross-parachain communication is native to Polkadot. Therefore, parachains will be able to send messages (including transactions and data) to each other “without the need for smart contracts to perform the bridging functionality.”

Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)
The PRE consists of the networking, consensus and WebAssembly Virtual Machine subsystems. Polkadot breaks the components of the PRE down to:
Network Interactions
State storage and the Storage Trie
Consensus Engine
Wasm Virtual Machine (VM)

Polkadot’s state machine is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a high-performance virtual environment. WASM is developed by major companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, that have created a large ecosystem of support for the standard. Polkadot's networking uses libp2p, a cross-platform network framework for peer-to-peer applications that handles the peer discovery and communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot runtime environment is being coded in C++, and Golang to make Polkadot accessible to a wider range of developers.

Bridging
Polkadot will eventually enable the connections to outside networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin through a series of specialized bridge contracts or modules. There are two different types of external bridging in Polkadot:
Bridge contracts: Smart contracts that connect Polkadot’s relay-chain to external chains (for example, the Parity Bridge between an Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (<a href="https://messari.io/article/proof-of-authority">PoA</a>) sidechain to a Substrate-based chain)
In-built bridging modules: Purpose-built modules that help external chains connect with Polkadot",

This governance system remained intact through Polkadot's mainnet launch and early existence. In late Jul. 2020, control over the protocol was transferred to the network's proposed on-chain governance system, which takes into consideration token holders, validators, a Council, and a Technical Committee. These network participants are now the primary source of upgrade submissions and approvals. Parity and Web3 can still develop and submit proposals of their own, but they must pass through the governance system before being implemented.",
onchain_governance: {
onchain_governance_type: "Delegated On-Chain Vote",
onchain_governance_details: "Polkadot’s future on-chain governance system that hands the future direction of the protocol over to a technical council, an on-chain entity consisting of members voted in by network stakeholders. This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as “inclusive, stake-based voting schemes.” Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.

Every 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens “for at least the enactment delay period,” which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.

What determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):
- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)
- If a Council submission that reaches a “Complete agreement,” Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)
- If a Council submission that reaches a “Majority agreement,” Simple Majority

At genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.

Polkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously “implemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.” The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee’s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.

This governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.

See Kusama referenda [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy) and the list of Kusama Council members [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/council).",

technology: {
overview: {
technology_details: "Aave’s shifted from a decentralized P2P lending strategy (direct loan relationship between lenders and borrowers, like in ETHLend) to a pool-based strategy. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead, they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool.

Flash Loans
Aave also allows loans to be taken out without any collateral by creating logic that if it's not repaid within the block time, the transaction gets reversed. These flash loans are designed to be used by developers to build tools that require capital for arbitrage, refinancing or liquidating purposes. An example would be if a user took out a loan on <a href="https://messari.io/asset/maker">Maker</a> and the collateral price dropped making it close to liquidation, they could use a flash loan to repay the Maker loan and receive their collateral back. They could then sell the collateral to repay the flash loan thus avoiding the liquidation penalty on Maker without ever needing to actually have the funds necessary for repayment.

Rate Switching
Another unique feature of Aave is that it allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rates in DeFi are traditionally volatile making it difficult to estimate the long-term cost of borrowing. If a user anticipates interest rates to rise they can switch their loan to fixed rate in order to lock in their borrowing costs for the future, and if they expect rates to decrease they can switch back to floating to then decrease their borrowing costs. There are two exceptions where the fixed rate can actually change and that is if the deposit earning rate increases above the fixed borrow rate because the system could get unstable by paying out more than its being paid. In that case, the fixed rate is rebalanced to the new stable rate. the other scenario which works in the borrower's favor is if the variable rate is lower than the fixed rate by 20%, the loan will automatically decrease to account for the difference.

background: {
background_details: "Uniswap was born out of an idea proposed in 2016 by Vitalik Buterin for a decentralized exchange (DEX) that would employ an on-chain automated market maker with certain unique characteristics. A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launch in November 2018. The protocol quickly gained liquidity and started facilitating meaningful volume. Six months after launching, a fundraising round was <a href="https://messari.io/article/paradigm-backs-decentralized-exchange-protocol-uniswap">completed</a>, led by Paradigm to allow the addition of two more employees.

What makes Uniswap unique is that it solves the problem of high spreads for illiquid assets on order-book exchanges. This problem exists because there is little incentive for professional market makers to provide liquidity on very thinly traded assets. However, with Uniswap, anyone can be a market maker by depositing assets into a pool and earning fees based on the amount of trading activity. One downside to this model is that there is substantial slippage for large orders as the price paid increases as the quantity demanded increases.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Uniswap is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of tokens on Ethereum. Unlike most other DEXs, there is no native token and every action occurs on-chain. Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. Uniswap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.

Price mechanism
Uniswap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of an ERC-20 token and an equivalent amount of ETH, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. Users can also swap between two ERC-20 tokens, however, Uniswap will perform two separate actions with each of their respective pools.

Providing liquidity
When liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.3% fee generated off each trade. These tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.",

Its block generation scheme is called Doomslug and its proposed sharding design is dubbed Nightshade. These technologies will work together to scale the network and minimize congestion. NEAR has also been designed to be developer and user-friendly as it features a few key innovations to accelerate the application development and user-onboarding processes. The NEAR blockchain was created and developed by the NEAR Foundation. Its mainnet went live in April 2020, and network validators voted to unlock token transfers in October 2020. NEAR's bridge to Ethereum (called the Rainbow Bridge) launched in March 2021.",

background: {
background_details: "NEAR was a machine learning project before it became a blockchain development platform. Illia Polosukhin and Alexander Skidanov started NEAR.ai in early 2017 to explore program synthesis: the field of automating programs from a human specification. Named for the science fiction novel The Singularity Is Near, the NEAR project drew from Illia’s work as a lead contributor for TensorFlow at Google and Alexander’s as the lead engineer at MemSQL. 

Researching program synthesis led the team to explore programmable smart contract platforms and crypto payments in late 2017 and early 2018. As they explored the solution space and tried out a variety of blockchain protocols, they realized the current state of the tech didn’t meet their needs and began to design a blockchain that could. Illia and Alex gathered a team of engineers and formally started building NEAR Protocol in August 2018.  The founding vision for the NEAR platform was to offer developers an easy path to building decentralized applications that can scale to mass usage. To achieve these goals, NEAR adopted a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to support transaction verification and block production. 

NEAR combines a horizontal scaling approach with a new consensus mechanism that splits the network into parallel shards and dynamically distributes the computation to increase the network's processing capacity. The network launched in April 2020, became community-operated in September 2020, and passed a vote to enable token transfers in October 2020.",

Security: Stakers receive awards in NEAR by staking their tokens and contributing to network security. NEAR's user of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) provides Sybil resistance from DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks.
Network Fees: The utility of the network is provided by storing application data and providing a way to change it by issuing transactions. The network charges transaction fees for processing the changes to this stored data. The NEAR network collects and automatically burns these fees, such that higher usage will lead to more NEAR tokens being burned. A minimum percentage of smart contract usage fees is allocated for developer rewards. This reward effectively incentivizes early application development that increase network use. When a contract is called, some portion of the transaction fees is generated by the network is automatically allocated to the contract. A minimum value has ben set as a system-level parameter and the developers can choose any value to or above this minimum value.

The network issues inflation rewards at a rate of 5% per year. Of these epoch rewards, 90% (4.5% total) goes to validators, and the remaining 10% (0.5% total) will go to the protocol treasury. Near also burns 70% of all transaction fees; therefore, real inflation (rewards - fees burned) could be less than 5% depending on the level of network activity. The other 30% of a transaction's fee will be rebated to the smart contracts touched by the transaction.

consensus: {
consensus_details: "The consensus mechanism implemented on NEAR is called Nightshade. Nightshade models the system as a single blockchain. The list of all the transactions in each block is split into physical chunks, one chunk per shard. All chunks accumulate to one block. Note that chunks can only be validated by nodes that maintain the state of that shard. 

Theoretically, each logical block contains all the transactions for all the shards. However, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be prohibitively expensive, it is never initiated. Instead, each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track. 

The consensus is based on the heaviest chain consensus. Meaning, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of validator nodes. The weight of a block is then the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. The weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilises a finality gadget that introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security.

overview: {
technology_details: "  NEAR’s blockchain uses a new consensus algorithm and a sharding architecture to achieve a relatively high level of performance. The key elements of NEAR’s technology are:
Dynamic Re-Sharding
Nightshade
Doomslug
Fees as Developer Rewards
Token Balance-Based Storage

Dynamic Re-Sharding
There are two ways to approach scalability - Horizontal and Vertical. NEAR has chosen to use sharding, which is a type of horizontal scaling technique. Sharding is an approach to scaling databases, and it involves spreading computing and storage capacity across multiple servers. In the world of blockchains, sharding involves partitioning a blockchain across subgroups of nodes and distributes computation across multiple parallelized sub-chains ("shards"). Sharding is not live on NEAR at the moment.

Once sharding goes live on NEAR, the network intends to regularly adjust the number of shards supported by the network based on user demand. The project calls this demand-based approach to scaling "Dynamic re-sharding." This scheme allows the network to only pay for the infrastructure and scale it needs at any given time. Dynamic re-sharding might be a more cost-efficient approach to scaling and securing a sharded network since node storage requirements can adjust with demand.

Nightshade
NEAR uses a new sharding approach called Nightshade to reach consensus and settle cross-shard transactions. Most sharded networks use a smaller validator committee that rotates its lead block proposer when validating transactions across shards. This approach introduces some difficulties to the validation process. For instance, these validator groups must either download the entire state of each shard or receive only the portion that changed. The validation process for either technique can be inefficient as the first one requires a bigger time frame and the second one requires a larger state size.

Nightshade offers a different model by modifying the typical sharding abstraction. It assumes that each shard works together to produce "chunks" of data that collectively create a single block. Blocks are produced with a regular cadence regardless of whether each individual shard has produced its “chunk” for that specific block height. Nightshade is a leader-based system, meaning it assigns a single validator to produce each block. This validator must assemble the data chunks generated by each shard during their leadership period into a block. Leadership assignments will rotate through the existing validator set. Validators don't accept transactions, only chunks.

Doomslug
Doomslug is NEAR Protocol's new block production technique. According to the team, it enables the network to achieve some sense of practical finality after one round of communication, with a finality gadget providing BFT finality after a secondround.  Practical finality in Doomslug (or Doomslug finality) is when a block is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed. Doomslug also allows the network to continue producing and finalizing blocks as long as over half of the validator set are online and honest, although the finality gadget will stall if less than two-thirds of participants are online.

Fees as Developer Rewards
NEAR distributes 30% of any transaction fee to the contract (or contracts) that transaction calls. The contract’s owner (often a developer group or a DAO) can decide how to allocate these funds. These fee “rewards'' effectively incentivize early application development on NEAR. The percentage of fees allocated to this reward is a system-level parameter (can be adjusted by governance), but developers may choose to receive any amount equal to or above this minimum value.

Token-Based Storage
NEAR token holders have the right to store data on the chain. For example, if someone holds a balance of 1 NEAR, it means that the person can store nearly 10 KB of data on the account. This model is similar to how checking accounts in banks require a minimum balance to have an account. It allows contracts that are maintaining important state to pay validators proportionally to the amount of data they are securing.

background_details: "The DAO hack gives rise to Ethereum Classic
The DAO hack and resulting <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork">hard fork</a> split the Ethereum network into two separate chains: <a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum">Ethereum</a> and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture fund that managed to raise ~$150 million in Ether in an April 2016 <a href="https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico">initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.  A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the hacker to steal 3.6 million ETH of the funds collected in its ICO.

A divide in the community formed around how to resolve the issue. One camp believed reverting the chain, thus erasing the hack from the network's history, was necessary to preserve the longevity of Ethereum. The other side reasoned mutability was antithetical to the ethos of crypto networks and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide led to a contentious hard fork at block 1,920,001, and the legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history rebranded to Ethereum Classic.

Before the DAO fork split the original Ethereum chain, there was just one group of users, service providers, developers, investors, and other network participants. The hard fork or "irregular state change" split not only the protocol layer but also the social and application layers. As the legacy chain, Ethereum Classic inherited the components outlined within the Ethereum whitepaper. At the time of the fork, Ethereum Classic was still identical to Ethereum regarding these original components. However, it soon began to diverge away from Ethereum by announcing its own roadmap and vision.

Philosophy and monetary policy change
The Ethereum Classic (ETC) community stresses the core principals of censorship resistance and (most prominently) immutability. And as a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, it features a Turing-complete <a href="https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts">smart contract</a> language to support the development of more complex <a href="https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. The Ethereum Classic community governs the network by the motto "Code is Law," which instills the belief that ETC transactions and dApps are truly censorship-resistant and immune to any third party interference.

ETC later (March 2017) adopted a new, Bitcoin-like monetary policy fit with a fixed supply cap and disinflationary emission schedule. The proposal drastically deviated from the original Ethereum monetary policy, which remains in flux as Ethereum core devs look to establish a more concrete economic model for its future <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> network. Instead of monetary flexibility (and some uncertainty), Ethereum Classic now features a max supply of 210,700,000 tokens and miner reward reductions every five million blocks. And unlike Ethereum, the community intends to stick with <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> as its consensus and token issuance mechanism.  

Development teams and future developments
ETC's structure varies from most blockchain projects, incorporating multiple development teams (IOHK, ETC Labs, and ETC Cooperative), each with their own goals. In general, most of these teams have focused on providing sidechain <a href="https://messari.io/resource/scaling">scaling</a> solutions, improving development tools (SDKs), and promoting cross-chain transactions so others can build on Ethereum Classic. Some of these efforts, including Connext's state channels and ChainSafe's bridge to Ethereum and Cosmos SDK-based chains, have already launched.

ETC is one of the few cryptocurrencies where investors can gain exposure to it through a traditional brokerage and or retirement account. Grayscale Investments created an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ticker ETCG) that allows investors to gain exposure to ETC without having to store or secure it directly.

51% attacks
As a minority chain using the Ethash mining algorithm, Ethereum Classic has been the target of multiple 51% attacks. The first attack occurred in Jan. 2019, when crypto exchange Coinbase <a href="https://messari.io/article/updated-ethereum-classic-has-experienced-multiple-100-reorg-attack-ethereum-classic-claims-not-an-attack-new-miners-being-tested-coinbase-rebuts">detected</a> a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The number of identified reorganizations eventually increased to a total of fifteen, twelve of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1 million).

In Aug. 2020, Ethereum Classic suffered three more 51% attacks. The first one resulted in a successful double-spend of 807,260 ETC (~$5.6 million at the time). The second attack occurred less than a week later and exhibited a similar reorg depth (about 4,000 blocks). The final Aug. 2020 attack resulted in a large reorg of 7,000 blocks, but there is no sign of a double-spend attempt as of yet. As for a possible solution, the ETC Cooperative would like to switch Ethereum Classic's hashing algorithm from Ethash to either Keccak-256 or SHA-3, which would mean Ethereum Classic would no longer be a minority chain and would potentially be less susceptible to similar attacks.",

For developers to reduce the risk of a potential fork during protocol upgrades and to keep development resources focused on working on the next phase of the Ethereum Classic, it was reasonable to diffuse the Difficulty Bomb for one year.

The chain experienced some syncing issues post-fork, leading some analytics companies to believe that ETC split post-fork. The ETC Cooperative later said it was not a contentious chain split. Instead, bugs in the OpenEthereum and Hyperledger Besu clients led to a poor syncing performance. Both the OpenEthereum and Hyperledger Besu teams have since released fixes to address these syncing and stability issues. The Core-Geth and Multi-Geth clients did not experience any issues.

Ethereum Classic developers are also encouraging node operators to migrate from Parity/OpenEthereum and Multi-Geth clients to the latest Core-Geth or Hyperledger Besu now that the upgrade is complete.

launch_details: "The Pre-Mine
Ethereum Classic's token distribution follows that of Ethereum, as the two chains have a shared history. Before the eventual split sparked by The DAO incident, ETH and ETC were the same asset (originally known as ETH).

The original distribution event occurred through a public token sale managed by the <a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum">Ethereum Foundation</a>, which sold roughly 60 million ETH (80% of the initial 72 million ETH supply). The sale took place between Jul. 22, 2014, and Sep. 2, 2014. The remaining 12 million ETH (20% of the initial supply) were allocated to the Foundation and early contributors. Of the ether sent to the Foundation:
3 million were allocated to a long-term endowment
6 million were distributed among 85 developers who contributed prior to the crowdsale
3 million were designed as a “developer purchase program” that gave Ethereum developers the rights to purchase ETC at crowdsale prices.

All other ETH (and now ETC) issuance that took place occurred through the process of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.

The Fork Distribution
When Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split following the DAO fork (on July 20, 2016), anyone who held ETH now owned equivalent amounts of ETH and ETC. When a contentious hard fork occurs, users of the original chain can claim the native asset issued on the new chain, if different. Since the Ethereum Foundation trademarked the name "Ethereum" and the "ETH" ticker, the legacy chain opted to rebrand itself to "Ethereum Classic" and use the ticker "ETC" for its native asset."

Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single <a href="https://messari.io/resource/mining">mining</a> pool could obtain a majority of the <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> on a given chain.

The GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including <a href="https://messari.io/resource/orphan-block">orphan blocks</a> in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain byweighingthe parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.

Mining
Ethereum Classic miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash as defined by the network's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level">difficulty adjustment</a> algorithm. Ethereum Classic recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.

Cryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href="https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. Since Ethereum and Ethereum Classic share the same mining algorithm at the moment, ASIC miners on Ethereum can shift their hash power over to Ethereum Classic to mine ETC. This opportunity combined with lower security spend on Ethereum Classic likely led to the various <a href="https://messari.io/resource/51-attack">51% attacks</a> registered on Ethereum Classic, the first of which occurred in Jan. 2019 followed by three more in Aug. 2020.

overview: {
technology_details: "Ethereum Classic (ETC) kept most of the original Ethereum technical features and architecture. It remains an account-based blockchain (as opposed to Bitcoin's <a href="https://messari.io/resource/utxo">UTXO</a> model) consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href="https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href="https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.

Ethereum Classic also continues to use the <a href="https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, the smart contract execution engine. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity or others such as the Python-based Vyper. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum Classic node operators and miners provide these resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas.

The fee to make transactions or execute smart contract operations on ETC is (gas price) * (gas limit), and fees are paid to miners for including your transactions in a block. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas users are willing to spend on a transaction, whereas the gas price is the cost users are willing to pay for each gas unit. A normal transaction on the network costs 21,000 gas but costs more if you are trying to execute something more complex as that requires more computational power. Users can also speed up their transactions by raising the gas price since that will incentivize miners to include the transaction(s) in the next block to receive those fees.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) uses Ethash as its <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. New blocks are generated every 15 seconds, on average, and the current miner reward for each new block found is 3.2 ETC which is reduced by 20% every 5 million blocks (about 2.4 years). ETC will be mineable until around 2070 when miners will reach the soft supply cap of between 210 million and 230 million. In addition to miner rewards, ETC rewards miners for discovering “uncle blocks”. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that arrived too late, meaning another miner already solved the PoW and claimed that block height's reward. This practice aims to decrease mining centralization, reduce the chance of unintentional forks, and boost network security. Every new block can contain at most two uncle blocks. Uncle block rewards are 3.125% of the miners' reward or 0.125 ETC.",

governance: {
governance_details: "All network changes are subject to the improvement proposal or ECIP process, which is a standardized model for proposing changes to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. In this model, anyone can submit code changes, dubbed Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP), that aim to either modify the core protocol or even the ECIP process itself. The ECIP process takes after the EIP and BIP systems used in Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.

Once the author submits a proposal, they must champion it to be successful, which consists of the author making themselves available to answer any questions from network stakeholders. Proposals must also pass through several stages before being implemented into node client software.

Proposals begin in the “Draft Stage,” and if successful, make their way to the “Accepted Stage.” Submissions must pass each stage by a rough consensus. Client developers may add the submitted changes to their clients at their discretion. There are no on-chain voting mechanisms Ethereum Classic relies on to make changes.

background_details: "The Internet Computer (IC) is a blockchain network built by the DFINITY Foundation that aims to run decentralized applications at web speed. It's an attempt to reinvent how users interact with internet applications as its nodes run on specialized hardware housed by various independent data centers. The IC lets developers deploy and run applications through the use of canisters, which are akin to smart contracts. Each canister has a storage capacity of 4GB. DFINITY’s vision is for its new internet infrastructure to support a wide variety of end-user and enterprise applications, such as social media, messaging, and data storage.

The project was founded as DFINITY in October 2016 by Dominic Williams. DFINITY raised a total of $121 million from contributors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, SV Angel, Aspect Ventures, Electric Capital, ZeroEx, Scalar Capital, and Multicoin Capital. In 2018, the DFINITY Foundation distributed ICP tokens to 50,000+ registered participants through an airdrop.

On December 18, 2020, DFINITY launched the alpha mainnet of the Internet Computer. The team then launched the Internet Computer into the public domain on May 10, 2021. Its public launch also marked the release of the Internet Computer’s source code and the ICP utility token's transaction and governance functionalities.",

Facilitating Network Governance: ICP tokens can be locked to create neurons that participate in network governance by voting, through which they can earn economic rewards. 
Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into “cycles,” which power computation in the role of fuel that is burned when it is used. The Network Nervous System (NNS) governance mechanism converts ICP to cycles at a variable rate. This rate is chosen to ensure users of the network can always create new cycles at an approximately constant cost in real terms, such that the cost of acquiring fuel is predictable. 
Participant Rewards: The network mints new ICP to reward and incentivize those contributing to the network and enabling it to function. These contributions include (1) the provision of “voting rewards” to those participating in governance, (2) the provision of “compute rewards” to those operating the node machines hosting the network, and (3) other miscellaneous activities."

A year later (February 2018), DFINITY opted to raise a private strategic round, securing $20.5 million in a round led by a16z (the crypto asset investment arm of Andreessen Horowitz) and Polychain Capital.

A few months later, DFINITY airdropped $35 million worth of ICP (then called DFN) tokens to interested users - although the giveaway was only available to non-United States residents.

overview: {
technology_details: "The purpose of the Internet Computer (IC) is to extend the public internet. The current internet is a network that connects everybody and everything, but systems and services run on infrastructure managed by private companies. 

The IC aims to upend this model through the creation of Chain Key Technology, which includes several complementary components like a new consensus model (Threshold Relay), Non-Interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), an on-chain governance system (the Network Nervous System or NNS), and decentralized identity (Internet Identity).

Chain Key Technology consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the nodes that make up the Internet Computer. It enables the IC to have a single public key, which is small enough (in size) to allow any device, like smartwatches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer.

Chain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for:
Adding new nodes to form new subnets to help scale the network
Replacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without stopping
Reviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed
Upgrading the Internet Computer Protocol, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features

The DFINITY R&D team has also invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation. Throughout the lifetime of a subnet, it is known by a single public key, and the other parties on the Internet Computer do not have to keep track of changing public keys.",

governance_details: "The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the brain that controls the Internet Computer. It's an algorithmic on-chain governance system that onboards independent data centers to the network. It also allows ICP token holders to vote on network improvement proposals and reach an agreement on parameter changes. Any user can submit a proposal to the NNS, and if it is adopted, it is immediately executed.",

onchain_governance_details: "The specialized node machines that host the Internet Computer run under the control of the Network Nervous System (NNS). The NNS is a decentralized, token-weighted governance system. Any user can submit a proposal to the NNS, and if it is adopted, it is immediately executed. The NNS can perform tasks such as upgrading node machines to update the protocol or apply security fixes, tweaking economic parameters, or forming new subnet blockchains to increase network capacity. It runs within the Internet Computer’s protocols and is able to make these changes without interrupting the network’s operation.

The NNS works by allowing users to stake ICP governance tokens to create voting neurons. Anyone can create a neuron. Users must give neurons a notice of withdrawal that determines their exploration period when creating them, where the length of the notice period is a configuration known as the “dissolve delay.” The voting power of neurons, and their relative claim to voting rewards, is proportional to the quantity of staked ICP, the length of the configured dissolve delay, and their “age.” Neurons can be made to vote manually, or automatically, by following other neurons in a form of liquid democracy.

Neuron holders are placed in a crypto-economic game, where they are incentivized to vote to adopt/reject proposals or configure neuron follows that lead them to vote automatically in a desirable way, according to what is most likely to drive the value of the Internet Computer network over the long term.",

MCO tokens held by Crypto.com will not be eligible for the CRO airdrop. and all unallocated CRO airdrop tokens will be used for Community development activities. 20% will be allocated to Ecosystem grants and 20% will go to a Capital Reserve.

Crypto.com Chain will utilize Tendermint Core as its consensus engine. The entirety of the supply has already been issued, but 50% has been set apart to incentivize  all actors providing services to ensure integrity and successful processing of the transactions. Indeed, 30% will be reserved for Secondary Distribution. The Secondary Distribution wallet will receive a daily token supply through  a smart contract.  10% will be issued the first year, 8% the second year, 6% the third year, 4% the fourth year and 2% the fifth year. Those tokens will be distributed as network fee incentives and progressively distributed on exchanges at prevailling market price. The rewards will be distributed to the following actors: Customer acquirer nodes (60%), Merchant acquirer nodes (20%) & Council Nodes (20%). Those actors will have to stake CRO in order to receive rewards. Moreover, 20% has been set aside for the Network long-term incentives.",

background: {
background_details: "The RNDR network idea was initially conceived in 2009 by Jules Urbach, the CEO of its parent company, the Los Angeles Tech company OTOY inc., a company specialized in GPU-based software solutions. The idea behind the RNDR network was leveraging blockchain technology to improve the usage of GPUs across the world for something other than Proof-of-Work for other blockchains. In a nutshell, RNDR intends to connect media creators in need of computing power to perform render jobs to people who have their hardware idle and want to monetize that. The RNDR tokens are used to pay the usage fees to these users. It also allows new users who are unfamiliar with Cryptocurrency an easy way to get started on the network while they get comfortable by using RNDR credits. Unlike RNDR Tokens, RNDR Credits can be purchased using PayPal and Stripe, directly through the RNDR Portal. When a user purchases RNDR Credits, those Credits are backed by RNDR Tokens that have been purchased off of an exchange by the RNDR Team. This means that when a creator pays for a job using RNDR Credits, node operators are paid out in RNDR Tokens for their work.  

The Initial Coin offer was conducted from Oct. 6, 2017 to Oct. 12, 2017. During the process a total of 4650922 RNDR were sold at $0.25 USD per token. In March 2018 the team announced that the total minted tokens in the ecosystem would be 536,870,912 RNDR. The process of contract migration started with a 1:1 migration ratio between old and new contracts in March 2018. The Genesis Mainnet release occured on Jun. 24, 2019 when the project was migrated from the Ropsten Testnet to the Ethereum Mainnet and from this point beyond. Then, in March 2020 the team announced a purchased plan of 4.5 million RNDR tokens on the Probit exchange, taking advantage of the market situations on that time.

The final product was launched in April 2020 and its accessible at  https://rndr.otoy.com/",

It allows participants to pay for animation and be paid for making their computing power available to other participants. A person with excess of GPU power can register his/her workstation on the RNDR network and earn tokens for completing render jobs. The network takes care of the job and resources allocation for the completion of the job, and the tokens earned by the node operators involved during the process can be used to pay for future render jobs in the network.   

Users with no experience in crypto can leverage the use of RNDR credits, that can be purchased using PayPal and Stripe, directly through the RNDR Portal. These credits are all backed by real tokens, meaning every time a user acquires credits the same amount of tokens are acquired by the RNDR team from an exchange. This helps ease the entrance of new players in the system, while endure the node operators will be paid always in the same native token.  

For users not using RNDR credits, a wallet needs to be created. It needs to be an ERC-20 compatible wallet, being MetaMask the preferred wallet of the RNDR team. It should not be a a wallet from an exchange. This wallet is then linked to the user profile and made available for make and receive payments.  

The RNDR network has two smart contracts. In February 2019 it was announced updates in the token to include additional escrow smart-contract functionality, and the token migration process started. The conversion of the Old to the new tokens was defined as 1:1, and has no deadline."

overview: {
technology_details: "The objective of RNDR is connect graphic creators in need of GPU power to perform render jobs to users with idle resources (Node Operators). The user in need of a render job pays for the service in RNDR, while the network takes care of the transaction and allocates the job among the nodes. A small percentage of the payment is charged as a service fee (0.5 to 5% of the total needed to process the job, depending on supply and demand), and helps to maintain the peer-to-peer network. To participate, users create accounts linked to the Ethereum Blockchain and unique wallets, and then start to interact with the RNDR token and network.  

The network confirms work using automated and user generated verifications. Creators are encouraged to approve jobs that are correctly processed through the system. Final renders are not released until all watermarked previews are confirmed, which incentivizes the creators to confirm the processed frames. If something goes wrong, a creator has the ability to reject the frame, and the frames will automatically be assigned to another node on the network for re-rendering.‌ It also uses Reputation Scores for both creators and node operators as the main mechanism for resource allocation in the network, in a way that creators with a higher reputation score will have access to more nodes, as well as node operators with better reputation scores will get jobs assigned faster.  

When a job is requested, the network will enter a transaction with 2 parties - the node operator, who is providing the computing power and the user who requested the render job to be run. The cost of the transactions is calculated in RNDR by the network and finally the smart contract moves the amount from one account to the other. The key players in this process are listed below:
The RNDR Network: Coordinates and facilitates the supply and demand for render jobs using smart contracts. It automatically allocates the render jobs across nodes and perform the payments for the services;  
Node Operators: Provide computing power to perform the render jobs and are paid by the network in RNDR tokens. Node operators can join the network using a desktop client, and then receive unique ID that will be linked to the wallet. Joining the web, the network can determine benchmark information that will be used to better allocate the resources.
Creators: The final users of the network. People in need of computing power to perform render jobs, which is achieved by connecting to a web interface, linking a wallet and selecting the job preferences. As soon as the work is processed, the user confirms that the output was generated and pays the fees.
Dual Operators: Users who play the role of node operator and creators. Usually sell to the network idle GPU power when not using their hardware to accumulate RNDR that can be used when in need of extra computing power to run a job.",

The former is used to relay value across VeChain's network, while the latter is utilized to power smart contract transactions as energy or "gas." The VeChain platform claims to give authorized stakeholders with a total view of critical information related to a product and its business processes (i.e storage, transit, supply and authenticity) as well as increase market transparency.",

VeChain blockchain development started in 2015 as a modified fork of Ethereum with a design focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and supply chain management. To date, VeChain has expanded their focus to multi-purpose functionality with customizable support for a range of enterprise uses. On-chain governance, cheap transaction fees, interoperability with non-blockchain technologies, and regulatory compliance are all priorities for VeChain core developers. VeChain wants to make all required information from manufacture to delivery (storage, transportation, and supply) available to all authorized parties for any enterprise business process that interacts with the VeChain Thor blockchain.

The team later discarded VEN in favor of VET when they launched a mainnet version of the VeChainThor blockchain. A token swap allowed holders to swap VEN for VET at an exchange rate of 1:100. VEN is no longer an active token.

VeChain initially minted 1 billion VEN tokens, which equates to 100 billion VET. The initial distribution of VEN (which in terms of percentages, is the same as VET) is as follows:
Private investors received 90 million tokens (9%); now 9 billion VET
Enterprise investors received 230 million tokens (23%); now 23 billion VET
Crowdsale investors purchased 277,162,634 VEN (27.7%); now 27,716,263,400 VET
The VeChain Foundation burned 132,837,366 VEN as part of the token sale refund process (13.3%)
Project team members received 50 million tokens (5%); now 5 billion VET
The Foundation gave themselves 220 million VEN (22%) for operations and development expenses; now 22 billion VET"

On Dec. 13, 2019, an attacker stole approximately 1.16 billion VET tokens from the VeChain Foundation's "buyback address." The Foundation attributed the cause of the hack to the negligence of its own staff and proceeded to have exchanges blacklist the addresses associated with the stolen funds.",

Thor is the core of the VeChain blockchain, which functions as a basic layer for message exchange, key management, and data storage. Business applications can be built on top of Thor for smart contract creation and data auditing. VeChain plans to develop Thor smart contract development with visualization tools and support for multiple languages.

VeChain IDs are a key component of the VeChain blockchain. Physical good tracked with VeChain are assigned digital identities created with a SHA256 hash and tracked with NFC, RFID, and QR codes. 

VeChain uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism that relies on masternodes to validate transactions. Authoritative masternodes are selected by the VeChain Foundation and the VeChain community after Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.

VeChain’s blockchain circulates two tokens. The first, VET, is the network’s primary medium of exchange for governance and payments. The second, VeThor (VTHO), is a token for a lower transaction fee model that is credited to VeChain users daily based on the amount of VET they hold. VeThor is used to executing smart contracts and transactions on the VeChain blockchain. 

VeChain blockchain users are categorized as users and service providers. VeChain users include manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and other enterprise clients. Service providers build specific applications on the network like smart contracts and other blockchain-based software applications. ",

After an internal investigation, the Vechain Foundation attributed the cause of the hack to the negligence of its own staff, citing an improper wallet creation allowed the attack to steal the Foundation's private key. The Foundation tagged the address, which would compromise any subsequent transactions as well, and notified "all exchanges to monitor, blacklist, and freeze any funds coming from the thief’s address."

background_details: "Fetch.ai, the artificial intelligence lab developing the Fetch.AI platform was founded in 2017 and launched via IEO on Binance in March 2019. The Fetch.AI mainnet went live in Jan 2020. The Cambridge-based artificial intelligence lab is building AI for blockchains.

Fetch.AI is an open-source decentralized machine learning platform based on a distributed ledger that provides users access to AI in the format of secure datasets.

On the Fetch.ai network, a series of software agents represent and act on behalf of their owners. These autonomous agents work to provide an optimized service across a variety of ecosystems, benefitting both suppliers and consumers. The Fetch.Ai framework aims to support billions of IoT devices to facilitate seamless communication in an automated and secure manner. Fetch.AI autonomous agents have the ability to conduct searches, negotiate and trade knowledge, and share both predictions and value.

The early use cases Fetch.ai is targeting include:
Optimizing trading for financial services users
Reconfiguring public transport networks
Supporting smart cities’ ability to adapt to citizen behavior
Disintermediate the gig economy to remove middlemen
Connecting energy networks to smart grids
By decentralizing access to data, Fetch.ai hopes to distribute the power of existing data monopolies. Fetch.ai’s framework is optimized via autonomous agents that categorize data semantically, geographically, or by economic features. Fetch.ai’s permissionless network enables anyone to share or exchange information via autonomous agents.",

token_usage_details: "Fetch.ai has both a native token as well as an ERC-20 token.

The Fetch.AI token is the native asset for the Fetch.AI network and is required for all network exchanges, as a refundable method of registering with the network, for staking, and as a mechanism for delivering value back to those performing work on the network.

The Fetch.AI token enables the protocol's autonomous economic agents to perform specific tasks. Fetch.AI’s token allows agents access to the digital world in the form of services, data, infrastructure, or access to data processing such as AI and ML algorithms.

Fetch.AI tokens are designed with various purposes including:

Operational Costs
Operation costs in Fetch.AI are decoupled from the Fetch.AI token in a similar way to that of “gas” on the Ethereum network, but with additional functionality designed to increase the stability of such “gas costs” and look at addressing issues associated with high and low-velocity economies. Fetch.AI’s operational fuel allows access to processor time for contract execution and services for agents.

Ability to connect agents and nodes to the network. 
This is an access deposit token that acts as a form of stake to demonstrate desire to behave appropriately. It modulates the ability for bad actors to flood the network with undesirable nodes or agents due to the escalating cost of doing so. 

Access and exchange value
The Fetch.AI token is required for agents to perform exchanges of value (data, service, etc). Since FET is divisible, low-cost and microtransactions are possible within the network. FET is needed to access, view, and interact with the network and digital world. Agents, which can represent digital entities, require FET in order to access aspects of the network.

Machine learning and Synergetic Computing services
The Fetch.AI token enables the development of and access to a broad range of machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks that are available on the ledger. These may be primary services, developed by Fetch.AI, such as trust and prediction models, or they may be large-scale independently developed services for network users. Fetch.AI refers to these collectively as Synergetic Computing."

consensus: {
consensus_details: "The Fetch.ai consensus is built using a unique combination of cryptographic and multi-agent systems theory. These unique features can be further extended to many other applications such as IoT and decentralized machine learning to enhance the capabilities of the Fetch.ai network.

Fetch.ai believes that blockchains require a time-to-finality rate that provides a comparable experience to current centralized payment systems. The finality problem is a technical limitation of blockchains that has acted as a barrier to wider adoption of blockchain technology.

Fetch.ai’s dynamic consensus is designed to help blockchains achieve finality sooner, making networks more efficient. Fetch.ai plans to assist non-blockchain applications with time-stamping activities in real-time.

The consensus mechanism uses unique tools that Fetch.ai has developed for generating decentralized and incorruptible sources of randomness. These cryptographic techniques can be used as oracles in applications that involve coordinating multiple stakeholders in areas such as finance, gaming, and logistics. Unbiased randomness can, for example, be used to choose which trades should be matched in decentralized exchanges, deal cards in a decentralized game of poker, or decide which company in a transport consortium should fulfill a delivery. Fetch.ai claims that this consensus mechanism will support both existing industrial applications and blockchain-enabled applications.

Incorruptible randomness is also key to the Fetch.ai Minimal Agency (min-agency) consensus, which is designed so that all users have fair access to the protocol. This is achieved by ensuring that individual validators have very little influence over which transactions reach the global state and their eventual ordering.

Minimal Agency consensus utilizes a hybrid system that combines some features of DAGs and blockchain-based ledgers.

The min-agency consensus uses a DAG to continuously synchronize transactions and ensures that all participants in the network can commit transactions to the global state at any time. In general, DAGs come with various tradeoffs including greater storage costs from holding redundant information and non-ordered transactions which poses some challenges for implementing smart contracts. Various DAG-based protocols implement solutions to help alleviate these tradeoffs.

The min-agency consensus collapses the DAG at regular intervals which occurs when a validator adds a signature (notarizes) vertices that have been validated by at least half of all validators. Subsequently, all of the transactions that have been notarized are converted into a block that is added to the blockchain to finalize the transactions.

In min-agency consensus, the ordering and choice over which transactions are added to the block is made by a deterministic algorithm that also uses cryptographic randomness. Fetch.ai asserts that min-agency consensus will improve fairness and censorship resistance thereby preventing abuses such as validator front-running users in decentralized exchanges.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Fetch.ai is a permissionless, tokenized, decentralized machine learning network to enable smart infrastructure built around a decentralized digital economy. The network support autonomous agents which can perform tasks such as delivering data or providing services and are rewarded with a digital currency for their efforts — the FET Token.
Fetch.ai has three key technological primitives that underpin the Fetch.AI network.

Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs)
An AEA is an intelligent program operating on an owner's behalf, with limited or no interference of the ownership entity, and whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner.
Autonomic agents can be thought of as digital entities that are able to make their own decisions. The Fetch.AI network dynamically reorganizes itself to provide an environment for agents to operate in.
Essentially, this means rearranging space to place agents that can provide value "close" to agents that are searching for that value. Each agent therefore "sees" a different world from its perspective: a world that
is reorganized for its perceived and declared needs.
AEAs can be used to represent real-world objects, people, or assets in a digital space and enable them to communicate and transact quickly and efficiently. AEAs act independently of constant user input and autonomously execute actions to achieve their goal.

Open Economic Framework (OEF)
The OEF is the high-level node functionality: the layer on top of the raw protocol and ledger that delivers this environment and all the other operations agents need to operate. This connectivity layer enables a decentralized search for autonomous agents who can then find each other and exchange with one another. Agents conduct these transactions using a Fetch.AI’s native asset, FET. Through these interactions, the agents negotiate and transact for their owners. This layer also provides interoperability between various systems connecting different devices, businesses, and services.

A Smart Ledger
The final aspect of Fetch.AI’s network is its AI-powered blockchain ledger which logs all of the agents’ transactions. As the agents and ledger gain more data it will provide public market intelligence, previously locked up in centralized silos.",

background: {
background_details: "Filecoin is looking to provide an alternative to traditional online storage providers and protocols. Its technology acts as an incentive layer for the peer-to-peer file transfer system IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which uses hash-addressed content structures to store data instead of centralized servers and IP addresses. This is intended to reduce redundancy, increase permanence, and improve efficiency. 

Filecoin incentivizes IPFS by rewarding storage providers and retrievers for contributing resources to the system. The network also comes with built-in Ethereum integration allowing developers to access data on Ethereum’s blockchain and interact with its smart contracts.

Filecoin is being developed by Protocol Labs, a development firm founded in 2014 by Juan Benet. Benet and crew constructed Filecoin and IPFS in tandem, raising a few Seed equity rounds to fund the process. In 2017, the team hosted a token sale to secure funds for Filecoin's development, which raised around $205 million in one of the largest token offerings at the time.

Protocol Labs seeks to build a fundamental layer for data infrastructure that can be used by both blockchain and traditional providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. The project plans to achieve this goal by creating a marketplace in which any user who has storage capacity can connect to the network, creating a supply of unused storage both in consumer hardware as well as data centers of existing businesses. The Filecoin team believes this will reduce the price of storage in a way similar to how sharing economy companies like Airbnb reduced the price of short-term rentals in marketplaces traditionally dominated by large players with large capital requirements.",

The team anticipates for this phase to run until Jun. 26, 2020, setting up the network for a tentative mainnet launch in mid-July or August. Filecoin initially expected to release Phase 2 around Feb. 24 but has pushed back the launch date multiple times for reasons related to ensuring network stability and the coronavirus pandemic.

The event will run for three weeks and will involve miners competing to onboard as much storage capacity as possible to the network. The top 100 miners globally will earn FIL token rewards based on how much storage they and the network achieve during the test period. Any rewards earned will be encoded into the genesis block and will vest linearly over six months from mainnet launch.

launch_details: "Within a short timespan in 2017, Filecoin raised $52 million in an advisor pre-sale followed by a $153 million public offering through token sale platform CoinList. It raised these funds using a relatively new method known as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). The SAFT is a legal agreement inspired by the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), pioneered by Y Combinator. It gives accredited investors an allocation of tokens once the network is live in return for an upfront investment.

Of the $205 million raised, $52 million was sold to advisors at a rate of $0.75 per FIL token, with an additional discount of between 0% and 30%. Vesting for advisors ranged from one to three years. The remaining $153 million was raised from investors with FIL tokens priced based on a linearly increasing function. The starting price for the sale was $1.00 per FIL and increased up to $5.00 per FIL using the formula (price = $ amount raised / 40 million), with a hard cap of 200 million FIL sold.  Investor tokens, from the advisor and token sale rounds, will vest on variable periods with a six-month minimum.

FIL has a max supply of two billion, of which 600 million were pre-allocated at genesis according to the following allocations (percentages based on max supply):
10.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs with a 6-year linear vesting
4.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs team member and contributors with a 6-year linear vesting
7.5% was allocated to 2017 SAFT investors with a 6-month to 3-year linear vesting
2.5% was allocated to future fundraising or ecosystem development
5% was allocated to the Filecoin Foundation with a 6-year linear vesting

The remaining 70% of the total supply is allocated to Filecoin miners and will be released over time to reward providing data storage service, maintaining the blockchain, distributing data, and running applications."

consensus_details: "Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt)
The Filecoin protocol intends to use Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) to prove files are stored securely over time within a decentralized network.
PoRep is a type of Proof-of-Storage featuring the specific properties that outlined in this post
PoSt defines the mechanism by which miners create blocks that are storing data. Clients (network users) can source miners of data storage and data retrieval, different operations that existing within separate decentralized markets. PoSt provides a level of verifiability so that data can be stored and retrieved in a distributed, multi-market system.

Mining
Storage miners can earn FIL by storing data for clients and "computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time." Unlike Proof-of-Work mining, the probability of earning a block reward (and transaction fees) is "proportional to the amount of storage the miner contributes to the network."

On the other hand, retrieval miners can receive FIL by winning bids for a client request. The market value of the file in question determines the miner's payout. Available bandwidth and initial response time for details (which could be influenced by network latency or proximity to a client) impact a miner's ability to close deals and retrieve data on the network. Therefore, the "maximum bandwidth of a retrieval miner will set the total quantity of deals" they can win.

With the network still in development, the mining equipment specifications (specifically for CPU and RAM) remain unknown. But the team insists the mining hardware will contain configurations with many standard hard drives and that any “specialized Filecoin mining hardware” will not exceed anything more than a highly optimized hard drive (in a sense, not optimal for ASICs). Filecoin also notes note that early storage and retrieval miners will be required to run full nodes.

overview: {
technology_details: "Protocol Labs introduced many new technologies in its Filecoin whitepaper that could add value to multiple blockchain projects. Filecoin is secured by proof-of-work in the same way that bitcoin is, but this work is specifically related to storage of data Instead of finding a random nonce to make the block hash fit in a target range, the networks proof-of-work is restricted to proving that a miner has stored data for a specific duration and replication. This is achieved with two new types of proof-of-work: proof-of-replication (PoRep) and proof-of-spacetime (PoSt). 

Proof-of-replication allows a server to convince a user that some data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical storage while proof-of-spacetime allows an efficient prover to convince a verifier that they are storing some data for a specified duration of time. 

These proofs allow Filecoin to solve issues with large-scale storage networks made of independent parties, by making it theoretically impossible to falsify data storage records to increase miner rewards. Competitors like Siacoin ($SC) and Storj ($STORJ) lack this functionality, though they have not yet created enough storage demand for this to be a significant issue. 

Miner proofs are used to create a network based on three primary methods, put, get, and manage. The put and get methods are responsible for putting data in storage and accessing it on client request respectively. The manage method is responsible for managing the marketplace by matching buy and sell orders as well as managing buyer and seller reputation on the platform. 

These methods are executed across two marketplaces, storage and retrieval, which are managed by the different miners. Protocol Labs believes that miners will often participate in both markets. Storage miners are responsible for receiving put requests and storing client data while also pledging collateral proportional to the data. They will be penalized by losing this collateral in the event of invalid or missing proofs. Storage providers run the manage method in conjunction with clients and auditors. Retrieval miners are responsible for managing get requests and giving clients their data. While retrieval miners do not need to pledge collateral, they are still compensated in the native Filecoin for performing work for the network. ",

Unlike other PoS models, PPoS does not reward, nor does it put validator or user funds at risk of being slashed (a loss of funds used to promote honest node and user behavior).

The end of the sale coincided with the Algorand’s mainnet launch, which created 10 billion ALGOs at genesis. A total of 2.5 billion ALGO tokens (25% of the initial supply) were granted to the founders and the Algorand Foundation to support continued protocol development. The rest of the ALGO will be distributed through rewards, grants, and auctions as detailed in the supply curve section. "

supply_curve_details: "Overview
Even though the entirety of the supply was minted at the launch of the network, thus giving Algorand a fixed outstanding supply, the liquid supply will inflate as pre-minted tokens unlock and are distributed, as described below.

End-user grants are dedicated to open-source developers and community members to help incentivize protocol development and innovation. The ALGOs will be distributed via various programs like hackathons, competitions, and events.

There will be a maximum of 10 billion ALGOs in circulation (minus the 20.5 million burned ALGOs from the inaugural auction early redemption program in Aug. 2019 as well as the 5 million burned Algos from the final auction redemption window in Jul. 2020). The ALGOs will be introduced into the network over time as follows:

Estimated ALGOs to be injected into circulation (initially via auction, distributed over time) - 2.5 billion
Estimated participation rewards (distributed over time) - 1.9 billion
Early relay node runners (distributed over time) - 3.1 billion
Algorand, Inc. - 2.0 billion 
Algorand Foundation - 0.5 billion

Auction refund program
In Aug. 2019, Algorand offered auction investors the opportunity to receive a 90% refund on their purchased tokens. Investor returns totaled $19.9 million tokens, which constituted almost 80% of the original auction supply. The Algorand Foundation later burned these ALGOs as well as the 609,343.1208 AGLOs that address received as participation rewards (aka inflation), permanently removing them from circulation.

In Jun. 2020, the 2019 Algo auction participants who did not avail of the early redemption window in Aug. 2019 qualified to opt for a second and final Auction redemption window. Investor returns totaled five million ALGO. As occurred during the optional early redemption in August 2019, all Algos returned via this refund mechanism were burned (permanently taken out of circulation).

Relay node accelerated vesting
On Sep. 30th, 2019, relay nodes voted in favor of delaying their ALGO payouts, which would allow Algorand and relay node operators to discuss potential modifications to the rewards schedule. Algorand investors USV and Pillar offered support for a new, elongated vesting schedule since the ALGO supply growth at the time was "too large relative to the state of adoption." Relay nodes opted to delay their ALGO rewards twice more until the network passed EIP-11252019AF, which extended the vesting plan from two years to five years, meaning payouts would complete by the end of 2024. But this new schedule rewarded relay nodes by increasing their share of the ALGO supply by 25% and offered an accelerated vesting schedule should the price of ALGO reach specific targets.

Unvested tokens dedicated to relay nodes will now vest according to the following guaranteed base vesting schedule:
Year 1 (2020) 3% (for a total of 17%, as relay nodes had already received 14% of their total share at this point)
Year 2 (2021), 8% (for a total of 25%)
Year 3 (2022), 25% (for a total of 50%)
Year 4 (2023), 35% (for a total of 85%)
Year 5 (2024), 40% (for a total of 125%)

Although this schedule can accelerate depending on the 30-day moving average of AGLO price, Algorand used the base vesting schedule to determine the supply curve.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Algorand utilizes a Pure Proof of Stake, where validators are not rewarded nor are they at risk of being slashed. It becomes impossible for the minority to cheat and irrational for the majority to cheat the system as it would devalue their holdings. There is also no locking of tokens so a user has their tokens available at all times. Blocks are created in two phases where a single token is selected randomly and its owner proposes the next block. Subsequently, 1000 random tokens are selected with their owners then approving the block proposed by the first user. 

These phases are ensured by the core protocol called Binary Byzantine Agreement, or Byzantine Agreement ★ (‘Star’), encompassing the following advancements:
Cryptographic sortition (self-selection) To prevent an adversary from targeting committee members, BA★ uses verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members in a private and non-interactive way. 
Participant replaceability. BA★ mitigates adversary targeting a committee member by requiring committee members to speak just once, thus becoming irrelevant to BA★. 

Experimental results running on 1,000 Amazon EC2 VMs demonstrate that Algorand can confirm a 1 MByte block of transactions in ~22 seconds with 50,000 users, latency remains nearly constant when scaling to half a million users, it achieves 125X the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, and that Algorand achieves acceptable latency even in the presence of actively malicious users. 

A test network for the protocol was launched in July 2018, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October 2018. As such, Algorand encourages anyone to audit its version of the VRF, forked and extended from the widely popular libsodium cryptographic library.  ",

Community members can post code changes on the network, and stakeholders can use the Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus model to vote on whether to accept or reject the changes.

At the moment, the Algorand team constructs and releases protocol upgrades. But as described in the consensus-based approach above, node operators ultimately determine whether to accept or reject the code changes. Once Algorand releases a protocol upgrade, at least 90% of network nodes must approve the change (done simply by upgrading their node) before the code changes are considered active (i.e., are accessible to users and developers). If approved, the remaining network nodes have a grace period of 140,000 blocks (about seven days) to complete the upgrade before being "kicked-off" (unable to sync with) the network. This "upgrade-required window" recently increased from 10,000 blocks to 140,000 blocks with the activation of Algorand v2.0.2",

background: {
background_details: "Cosmos aims to combine the utility of open-source software, decentralized networks, and time-stamped blockchain data storage to accelerate the scaling, adoption, and use-case experimentation of blockchains. To bypass the hindrances such as limited performance and ad hoc governance that inherently exist in PoW chains, Cosmos was envisioned as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable PoS blockchains. The ideal solution, according to Cosmos, was a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the unique value proposed by a chain can be expanded to any other chain.

The idea of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism originates from the year 2014 when the future Tendermint Inc. co-founder Jae Kwon explored the possibilities in his research. With the participation of Ethan Buchman, the other Tendermint Inc. co-founder, this idea was further developed in 2015, and Cosmos was introduced in 2016. Tendermint Inc. and Interchain Foundation (ICF) have been responsible for the development and adoption of the technologies underlying the Cosmos network, Tendermint Core (a BFT consensus mechanism) and the Cosmos SDK (a modular framework for building new blockchains).

ICF ran a successful initial coin offering for ATOM in 2017 and used the collected funds to boost the development of Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Peggy. The first blockchain of the network, Cosmos Hub, launched on mainnet in 2019, and since then, many well-known projects have sprouted in the network such as Terra, THORChain, and Crypto.com.",

details: "a href="https://messari.io/article/introducing-stargate-the-next-major-cosmos-upgrade"Stargate/a introduced an extensive set of upgrades to the Cosmos Hub, including new interoperability abilities and various performance improvements. It involved the transition of the third version of the Cosmos Hub (Cosmos Hub 3) to a fourth iteration (Cosmos Hub 4). Stargate's primary new feature was the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, the interoperability standard that enables the exchange of cryptoassets and data across other Tendermint-based chains. Stargate also included several user-experience and performance upgrades, such as:
Protobuf Migration to increase transaction throughput and lower gas costs by increasing block capacity. It also introduces a composability standard

While Tendermint constitutes the networking and consensus layer of the application-specific blockchains built within the Cosmos network, Cosmos SDK offers a framework to construct the application layer by building deterministic state machines through SDK modules. Since the consensus mechanism and application layer are separate informational domains in Cosmos blockchains, the changes in the state-machines (e.g. transactions on the blockchain) are communicated to the Tendermint consensus engine through the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). Another implication of this separateness is that the blockchains on the network are not limited by strict rules when choosing a consensus mechanism. They do not require to use of Tendermint's vanilla version and can make adjustments on the consensus mechanism to render it suitable for application-specific purposes.",

All the zones in the Cosmos network have distinct governance styles tailored for the value proposition of the blockchain. The Cosmos Hub, on the other hand, employs a hybrid governance model where it uses an off-chain governance platform for discussions and uses on-chain voting for decision-making and execution. Any user can submit proposals on protocol upgrades, modifications to network parameters, bounty allocations, and other governance policies and participate in discussions on the Cosmos governance forum. Since community governance plays an essential role in the development and stability of the network, Cosmos Hub obliges each validator to vote on every proposal. Those who do not vote, get penalized by the protocol and their validator status gets deactivated for a predetermined period of time. The Cosmos Hub also benefits from an additional aiding agent named Governance Working Group which aims to equip Cosmos governance with structural tools, improve governance functionality, and conduct educational efforts to further the awareness and the adoption of Cosmos governance.",
onchain_governance: {
onchain_governance_type: "Delegated On-Chain Vote",
onchain_governance_details: "Proposals go through four different phases before either being accepted and executed or rejected.

__Phase 1: The Deposit Period__ 
Anyone can submit a text proposal to the system, but the proposal needs to be backed with a minimum deposit of [64 ATOM](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/47)s within two weeks after the submission date to proceed into the voting phase.  This requirement is a protective measure against proposal spamming.  The party submitting the proposal does not necessarily need to provide the deposit themselves, or in other words, any ATOM holder can contribute to this deposit to support the proposal. Contributors can reclaim their tokens once the proposal gets accepted or if it fails to reach the minimum threshold after two weeks.

__Phase 2: The Voting Period__ 
The deposit period ends once the proposal reaches the minimum deposit amount and a two-week-long voting period begins. There are four voting options (“Yes”, “No”, “No with Veto”, “Abstain”). During the voting process;
- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance.
- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of ATOMs staked determines the direct influence of the user on the decision-making process (coin voting).
- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they individually cast their vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.
__Phase 3: Tallying Results__ 
Following requirements need to be satisfied for a proposal to get a passing vote:
- __Quorum__: More than 40% of the total staked tokens need to have participated in the vote.
- __Threshold__: More than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding “Abstain” votes) need to have voted in favor of the proposal (“Yes”).
- __Veto__: The number of votes cast for "No with Veto" shouldn't be greater than 33.4% of the tokens that participated (after excluding “Abstain” votes).
The proposal gets rejected if one of these requirements is not met at the end of the voting period. And if a proposal fails to pass the vote for any reason, the deposited tokens associated with the submission are not refunded and instead transferred to the community pool.

__Phase 4: Implementing the Proposal__ 
Accepted proposals regarding protocol upgrades and network parameter modifications are integrated with a new version of Cosmos. Proposals regarding fund allocation, marketing activities, or any other decision that needs to be executed off-chain require additional operational management from the community.

Currently planning on a testnet release sometime this year, currently the network only supports a private devnet. The Celestia layer is meant to simply order transactions and verify that the data published in said transactions is available (known as the 'data availability layer'). This allows other blockchains to build on top of Celestia to improve scalability and interoperability.",

background_details: "Originally theorized in a research paper by Mustafa Al-Bassam, Celestia (then LazyLedger) aims to use a modular approach to scaling blockchains. Led by key members in the Cosmos and blockchain scaling community, Celestia, still in development, has already raised $1.5 million in a strategic seed round to execute this approach. The devnet was first launched in November 2021, with only 7 network participants at the time (validators). The project plans to release an incentivized testnet for users later this year (2022) followed by a mainnet launch in 2023.",

overview: {
technology_details: "Celestia is a layer one blockchain network that serves to reduce the overhead of any blockchain built on top of it. The project proposes a modular approach to scalability rather than the traditional monolithic architecture that most layer one networks use. Celestia simply orders and publishes data pushed by developers and validators. Chains built on top of Celestia can then execute using said data in their own sovereign execution environment while inheriting the security Celestia's consensus network can provide. Splitting the traditional monolithic layer 1 architecture into a 2 layer system (data availability layer + execution layer) is the core of what set Celestia apart from other networks. Cosmos Tendermint already makes the distinction between consensus and application layer, while Celestia is meant to operate as a data availability layer between consensus and execution to increase scalability.",

background: {
background_details: "KuCoin is a cryptoasset exchange that describes itself as a hybrid exchange integrating features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The long-term goal of the team is to transition to a fully decentralized exchange model. 

Currently, the exchange operates through more of a centralized model, attempting to duplicate best practices in traditional asset exchanges including dedicated risk and compliance teams. These teams are responsible for internal controls and cross-departmental reviews aimed at reducing fraudulent activity on the platform.

KuCoin Shares (KCS) is a token used to reward users and attract new customers to the exchange. Users holding a specified amount of KCS in their account are eligible for discounts on trading fees. Furthermore, holders of KCS receive a daily dividend, called a KuCoin bonus, equal to 50% of trading fees on the exchange. Those that have referred new users to the platform are eligible to receive 40% of fees while the exchange retains the remaining 10%. Dividends are paid in whichever token was the most traded during the day.

To encourage referrals, each user receives a registration link they can share. Referral bonuses are paid for both direct and indirect activity. Users receive bonuses for both the activity of their direct referrals as well as the activity from any new users their referrals add to the platform. Users holding enough KCS in their exchange account receive a discount on trading fees. KCS held off-exchange is not eligible for this rebate program. Additional benefits such as a personal investment consultation and expedited customer service are offered to users on a tiered basis as they increase their KCS holdings.

While trading rebates and referrals are the current use case for KCS KuCoin plans to use the token for transaction fees once they launch a fully decentralized platform. Current trading fees on the exchange are 0.1% at the time of this report.",

Founders were allocated 35% of total supply (70 million KCS) subject to a vesting period. Starting Sep. 2, 2018, 25% of allocated tokens will be available for sale on an annual basis ending on Sept. 2, 2021. Early investors, “influencers,” and consultants were allocated 15% of supply (30 million KCS) which is locked until Sep. 2, 2019. 

KuCoin intends to buy back and destroy 50% (100 million) of the token supply over time resulting in a long-term fixed supply of 100 million KCS once the buyback is complete. The funds to facilitate the buyback program comes from the 10% of trading fees from exchange operations it plans to retain. Buybacks are published to the KCS blockchain explorer, allowing holders to confirm the purchases are meeting KuCoin’s announced objectives.",

overview: {
technology_details: "KuCoin was created using the guidelines for regulated financial institutions in Hong Kong. All user data is encrypted and stored in line with these standards. To minimize the chances for disruptions the operations team is split between two sites in Hong Kong and Singapore. Three data centers are maintained with overlapping functionality so operations for the entire business can be run using any of the centers.

The trading system is designed to handle high trading volumes, up to one million orders per second, through desktop and mobile interfaces.

KuCoin uses multiple wallets with varying levels of security based on the time frame for transactions. Micro-transactions are supported through a multi-firewall private network built on Amazon Web Services. KuCoin employees are provided with a unique cipher code to initiate withdrawals from the wallet. Longer term holdings are stored in bank custody with multiple signatures via independent private keys required to access them.

Withdrawal requests are first inspected using an internal artificial intelligence algorithm designed to process transactions instantly while still maintaining risk and security measures. KuCoin also offers multifactor authentication for transactions. 

KuCoin hopes to release a feature whereby exchange participants can self-register new cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically to help reach the goal of having 1,000 tokens listed and a daily exchange volume exceeding 100,000 BTC by December 2018. 

Tokens that fail to meet ongoing listing standards are not immediately delisted on the exchange but are instead put under special treatment rules. Projects may fall under this classification if they are likely to cease activities during the next three months, fail to have enough volume to make markets, appear insolvent, fail an audit, fail to report details in a timely fashion, engage in malicious market activities, dissolve the founding team, or any other reason at the discretion of KuCoin. 

Projects in special treatment are designated as such on the platform, so exchange participants are aware the associated token is a candidate for delisting. 

At the end of the observation, period tokens are delisted if they continue not to meet the volume required for listing or the project does not take the necessary actions to remedy the reason special treatment was applied. Alternatively, if a project passes the review, it is restored to the platform in good standing, and the special treatment designation is removed.",

background: {
background_details: "Stacks' Ivy League origins
Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea founded Blockstack (which later rebranded to Stacks) in 2013 at the Princeton Computer Science department to solve the underlying problems of current web and mobile apps. Muneeb’s Ph.D. thesis was on Blockstack. The two led their new startup through the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/y-combinator">Y Combinator</a> accelerator in the summer of 2014. Upon completion, the two raised a seed round led by <a href="https://messari.io/organization/union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures</a> (USV), with participation from <a href="https://messari.io/person/naval-ravikant">Naval Ravikant</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/svangel">SV Angel</a>, and others.

After launching a blockchain-based decentralized identity (DID) system in 2014, the team released the initial design for the then-Blockstack platform in 2015. They began R&D on its peer-to-peer communication and data storage system. The R&D phase lasted through 2017 and concluded with Blockstack releasing an alpha version of its developer platform, which included a developer release of the Blockstack Browser and a decentralized storage system. By the end of 2017, the company also secured two additional funding rounds via a Series A, led by USV, with participation from <a href="https://messari.io/organization/lux-capital">Lux Capital</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/digital-currency-group">Digital Currency Group</a>, and others, as well as a token offering through the Reg D framework. (See the Fundraising section below for more details)

Reenvisioning how users interact with applications
With its initial funding secured, Blockstack continued to realize its vision: building a full-stack solution for decentralized<a href="https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps"> </a>applications (<a href="https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps">dApps</a>). The platform's focus is to replace the reliance on centralized cloud service providers and applications that require the storage of user information on these services to operate.

At a high level, Stacks processes run on the user’s client, and data is stored individually. While the platform integrates a native blockchain, most computing is done on the edges, i.e., client devices. This design allows Blockstack to run a scalable network that uses the blockchain only when necessary.

Users can control their data on Stacks thanks to a unique ID system, which is recorded on the blockchain. This ID gives users the ability to independently store data in a medium of their choice and removes the need to maintain passwords for authentication.

Mainnet launch and Reg A qualified token offering
Stacks released a testnet for its blockchain (dubbed the Stacks network) in Q2 '18 and officially launched the Stacks v1 mainnet in October of the same year. This launch also distributed tokens to early investors and unlocked token transactions.

The team also introduced a pilot of its App Mining program with 38 registered apps. App Mining is Stacks' mechanism for incentivizing projects and developers to build on the Stacks network as the top applications by monthly active users receive STX rewards. The number of participating Stacks Ecosystem apps ballooned to almost 300 in its first twelve months. Stacks has since paused the App Mining program due to the challenges involved in providing an objectively fair distribution and weeding out those projects that were gaming the system. The Stacks Foundation plans to reopen the program under a new design after the launch of Stacks v2.

In July 2019, Hiro PBC (then called <a href="https://messari.io/organization/blockstack-token-llc">Blockstack PBC</a>) held the first token offering to qualify for the Reg A exemption. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the startup spent almost a year working with the SEC to meet the qualifications. By meeting the exemption terms, Hiro's unprecedented token offering landed the company another $15.5 million in capital. Investors received their tokens via a network hard fork about a month after the sale closed.

Current status
Hiro PBC is headquartered in New York City with a team that includes computer scientists from Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and other top universities. Hiro PBC is the public benefit corporation at the heart of the Blockstack ecosystem.

As of November 2019, Hiro PBC has raised over $75 million from equity investments and token offerings -- about $23.0 million from two token offerings in 2019, $47.5 million from a token offering in 2017, and $5.1 million in equity investments. Investors in the Stacks Ecosystem include USV, Lux Capital, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/zhenfund">Zhen Fund</a>, HashKey, Recruit Holding, SNZ, Digital Currency Group, Y Combinator, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/foundation-capital">Foundation Capital</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/organization/winklevoss-capital-management-llc">Winklevoss Capital</a>, and over 4,500 other entities and individuals.

As of Oct. 2019, almost 300 applications are built on the platform with contributions from more than 100 independent developer teams. The Stacks network is still in v1, with v2 expected to launch sometime in Q4 2020. The next iteration, Stacks v2, will introduce functionality for Stacks' native smart contract language called Clarity and a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Transfer (PoX). Under PoX, independent Stacks miners will secure the network by pledging Bitcoin as collateral in exchange for the chance to earn newly minted STX tokens. The pledged Bitcoin will go to STX stakers (which Stacks calls "stackers"), who also help secure the network.

The project underwent a full rebrand in Oct. 2020. First, the community rebranded the Blockstack network and application ecosystem to the Stacks Ecosystem. Then, Blockstack PBC changed its company name to Hiro PBC and shifted its focus from guiding the Stacks blockchain to building developer tools for the network.",

The primary difference between the first and second iterations of Stacks is the block production and transaction verification process. Stacks 2.0 uses the new PoX mechanism, whereby STX holders contribute to the network's security by "stacking" (similar to staking) their tokens. In exchange for their participation in consensus, stackers receive BTC rewards, which come from Stacks 2.0 miners. These miners are the ones that produce new blocks and order transactions, and they each new STX tokens as a reward for their contributions.

The Stacks 2.0 mainnet launched on Jan. 14, 2020."

According to the official SEC filing, the offering allowed Hiro to raise up to $28 million from both accredited and non-accredited investors while a concurrent Reg S could raise an additional $10 million from non-U.S. investors. The proceeding two-month dual sales netted Blockstack a total of $23 million.",

The initial supply of 1.32 billion STX were allocated as follows:
8.34% was allocated to a Long-term treasury. These tokens are locked until October 30, 2021, and will then follow a three-year time lock. 
13.53% was distributed to the Founders. These tokens follow a three-year time lock starting on October 30, 2018.
8.23% was distributed to Equity Investors. These tokens follow a three-year time lock starting on October 30, 2018.
5.65% was reserved for Employee distribution. These tokens follow a three-year time lock starting on October 30, 2018, apart from 5,534,869 of them.
29.93% was distributed to 2018 Token Sales participants. These tokens follow a two-year time lock starting on October 30, 2018, apart from 50,000,000 of them, which vest over four years.
9.09% was distributed to 2019 Token Sales participants. These tokens follow a two-year time lock starting on October 18, 2019.
3.03% was reserved for the Reg A App Mining. This program is meant to reward both application developers who create well-reviewed applications and the reviewers of those applications.
22.20% was allocated to a Short-Term Treasury. These tokens follow a two-year time lock starting on October 18, 2019.

In the case of an approximately two-year time lock, 1/24th of the tokens are unlocked at the time of distribution, and 1/24th unlock on an approximately monthly basis then onward. In the case of an approximately three-year time lock, 1/36th of the tokens are unlocked at the time of distribution, and 1/36th unlock on an approximately monthly basis then onward."

The Stacks network operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and leverages its Proof-of-Work (<a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">PoW</a>) security model. The Hiro PBC team selected this approach because bootstrapping a PoW network is difficult and time-consuming, and it would compete directly with Bitcoin to win mining resources. Instead of mimicking Bitcoin's success outright, Blockstack miners participate in a Proof-of-Transfer consensus model, where miners relinquish their BTC as the economic cost for their participation (akin to electricity and equipment costs in traditional mining). 

In the event of a fork (if two different miners propose valid blocks simultaneously), Stacks clients will need to eventually select the longest fork as the valid chain. This design is similar in nature to Bitcoin, where the fork with the most accumulated "work" is considered the correct chain.

Leader selection
The likelihood of winning the right to mine the next block (and earn the block reward and any accompanying transaction fees) increases with the amount of Bitcoin a miner burns compared to other participants. On a more granular level, Stacks determines the next block via a verifiable random function (VRF). VRFs to ensure the miner selection process remains random and impractical to game.",

overview: {
technology_details: "The Stacks Ecosystem can be broken down into five key components:
The Stacks Blockchain
Clarity smart contracts
Gaia data storage system
Stacks Authentication
Stacks Libraries and SDK

The Stacks blockchain
The Stacks blockchain is the coordination layer for the Stacks Ecosystem. It allows for the storage of user IDs and smart contract processing in addition to maintaining the native Stacks token. The first version of the blockchain used by Stacks operated on top of the Bitcoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">$BTC</a>) blockchain and recorded transactions directly to the chain using a proof-of-burn mechanism. For version two Blockstack will introduce a new chain that uses Tunable Proofs for consensus. 

Tunable Proofs allow the chain to use numerous inputs and assign weights to these inputs. In order to bootstrap their blockchain (ensuring that there is enough hash power from the start), Stacks will rely on a heavier weighting to the previously used proof-of-burn model in combination with native <a href="https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a>. Once there is enough <a href="https://messari.io/resource/hash-power">hash power</a> supporting the Stacks blockchain the weighting can shift towards native PoW. 

Adding efficiency to the Stacks blockchain is the Atlas Peer Network, which acts as an extended storage layer for the chain. Peers on the network attempt to store full replicas of the data allowing for less load on the Stacks chain. While many blockchains attempt to store all data directly on-chain the Stacks chain stores only hashes and relies on Atlas to store the full data.

Clarity smart contracts
Stacks has introduced a new smart contract language called Clarity. Clarity focuses on security, and predictability and is, therefore, non-Turing complete for single transactions and is directly interpreted by the virtual machine. Systems that compile code before it is deployed run the risk of introducing bugs that were not included in the original code. The lack of Turing completeness also enables static analysis which provides granularity on the cost and behavior of smart contracts before they are deployed. 

Gaia storage system
An additional feature that enables scalability and user security is Gaia. Gaia is Stacks' storage system that removes the need for applications to store user data and instead gives the user a choice in where to store their data in a private encrypted manner, be it on a cloud provider or a local server. The Stacks blockchain, along with Atlas, stores pointers that allow applications to access user data. Information is encrypted when stored and only accessible when a user provides approval via their cryptographic keys. 

Stacks authentication
The process of permissioning applications and retrieving data is largely invisible to users who instead interact with Stacks' authentication system. When a user logs into an app using their Stacks ID the user's client manages the authentication process directly from their device removing the need for server-side verification like passwords or 0Auth. A Stacks ID is used to interact with any application on the platform.

Stacks libraries and SDK
These various components are tied together with Stacks' SDK for developers and the user-facing Stacks browser which functions as an authenticator, app browser, and ID manager. ",

background: {
background_details: "Developed from a partnership between StarkWare and Immutable, Immutable X serves as a direct response to the current challenges facing NFT ecosystems on Ethereum. NFT transactions have accounted for as high as 30% of all network activity, often experiencing slow processing times, high gas fees, and even failed trades. Immutable X employs a specific zero knowledge (zk) rollup, called a zk STARK (developed by StarkWare) to combat these persistent issues. The network boasts up to 9,000 transactions per second, while using no gas costs, and leveraging Ethereum’s Layer 1 security.   

A primary goal of Immutable X is to serve as a back-end, liquidity platform for products, marketplaces, or games using NFTs. Additionally, the project seeks to lower entry barriers for game developers by implementing APIs and programming language-specific SDKs. This is to facilitate much faster game development and promote greater access to the Immutable X wallet in a platform-agnostic manner.  

Immutable X also posits itself as a true carbon-neutral organization, relying on its zk rollup solution to greatly minimize any significant carbon footprint. The remaining emissions created are subsequently offset through various monetary investment efforts.   

Functionally, any NFT on Immutable X can be traded anywhere within a partner organization’s ecosystem. For example, Immutable X and GameStop have agreed to a partnership, where Immutable X will become a Layer 2 platform for GameStop’s NFT marketplace, and GameStop will establish up to $100M worth of IMX tokens for developer and contributor grants. Once launched, the marketplace will have access to every Immutable-developed game asset moving forward.",

token_usage_details: "IMX tokens primarily serve "pro-network" functions such as building applications, direct value exchange, and providing liquidty. More specifically, the IMX token draws fees, can be staked, and offers decentralized governance.   

Below are descriptions of each utility:  
-20% of network fees must be paid in IMX. Users do not need to hold IMX to facilitate these transactions, as the network can automatically swap the actual purchase currency (e.g. participants can pay 100% in ETH, and Immutable will convert the mandatory 20% into IMX).  
-All fee-produced IMX tokens are sent to a staking rewards pool. This pool proportionally distributes tokens on a daily basis to those actively staking IMX tokens. For IMX tokens to be considered staked, they must be held on L1 or L2 and the member must have voted on a governance proposal within the past 30 days. Additionally, members  must have completed a trade within the preceding 30 days or be holding an NFT on the network.   * 

Note: Rewards are distributed on L2, dictating that members must have an L2 wallet linked to their L1 wallet to receive reward tokens.* 

-Member voting accounts for a significant portion of the token’s utility. To vote on proposals, the member must be holding a certain number of tokens. This threshold, like other governance protocols, is subject to change pending the voting community. Potential voting proposals include supply changes, token reserve allocations, and developer grants."

Assets remain in state as a Merkle tree (every leaf node is a vault containing an asset). The other nodes exist as a hash of its two children. The logic governing this tree is encoded in an on-chain smart contract (governing deposits, withdrawals, and state updates) as well as the L2 proof logic, written in StarkWare’s Cairo language. This will determine the 7 requirements for valid state transitions (the asset being transferred is owned by the user transferring it).

overview: {
technology_details: "Immutable X utilizes its STARK zk rollup scaling solution to achieve both lower costs and scalability. Primarily, its architecture is comprised of the rollup scaling engine, Link UI, and its APIs. The APIs wrap the Immutable X exchange engine's logic in a way that prevents developers from needing to interact with smart contracts directly. This, in conjunction with its SDKs, ultimately allows developers to focus on the fundamental components of game design while back end tasks are relegated to Immutable X.   

To support consistent data availability to its users, the protocol maintains two availability modes, rollup and validium. Rollup mode incurs a small linear transactional cost as state changes between batches are published to L1. In validium mode, each batch is signed by a Data Availability Committee (DAC) to indicate proof of data retention. This is so that even in the event of Immutable going offline, users will still be able to access their data.   

Assets can be minted on L2 with immutable metadata, which acts as a blueprint when interacting with L1 move or withdraw assets. This makes ERC 721 tokens both highly accessible and secure, while supporting a far higher quantity and speed when minting NFTs. To finalize transactions, users must provide key pair signatures taken from the network's STARK protocol. Immutable X has built what they call "Link" Layer between any Ethereum wallet and Immutable X. The key pair is ultimately generated based on the user's signature of a security message. With this utility, even if the STARK key pair becomes lost, signatures can be re-generated using an Ethereum signature, as the wallet's security is tethered to its corresponding Ethereum wallet. From a usability perspective, users can authorize various asset transactions from partner platforms, as partners of the project can embed the Link interface directly.   

Building on the project's Link interface, a further aim revolves around providing more ubiquitous liquidity for developers and network participants. By maintaining a shared orderbook, all connected marketplaces will show Immutable's listed assets. This means that users can transact with assets from a different marketplace than they are currently using. More collective asset listings raises visibility and subsequently, demand. Maker and taker fees are automatically configured by Immutable's shared asset book.",

background_details: "EOS was published by software publisher <a href="https://messari.io/organization/block-one">Block.one</a> and development is led by CTO <a href="https://messari.io/person/dan-larimer">Dan Larimer</a>, who founded Steem (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/steem">$STEEM</a>) and BitShares (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitshares">$BTS</a>). The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum">$ETH</a>), NEO (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/neo">$NEO</a>), and Cardano (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/cardano">$ADA</a>). EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance.

EOS makes use of <a href="https://messari.io/article/on-chain-governance">on-chain governance</a> whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or stakeholder bylaws. The EOS User Agreement defines and enforces the user bylaws. The rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement that users must agree to. This community developed agreement replaced Block.one's Constitution by a majority BP vote back in April 2019.

Ecosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform. The most prominent is a $325 million fund ran by <a href="https://messari.io/person/michael-novogratz">Mike Novogratz</a> called Galaxy Digital EOS VC.",

Block.one also relayed it will build a new WebAssembly engine EOSVM to compliment the product. Voice will have its own native token, which can be used to bump posts on the platform.

The new social media platform cost a href="https://messari.io/article/block-one-pours-150-million-into-its-new-social-media-platform"$150 million/a and one year to build according to statements made by Block.one CEO a href="https://messari.io/person/brendan-blumer"Brendan Blumer/a.

In preparation for the app's development, Block.one un-staked 3.3 million EOS tokens to a href="https://messari.io/article/block-one-buys-20-million-worth-of-ram-before-june-1st-big-announcement"purchase more RAM/a."

title: "Reduce Annual Inflation from 5% to 1%",
date: "2020-02-25T05:00:00Z",
type: "Economic Policy",
details: "In Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.

This vote conducted by network Block Producers followed a poll held by EOS holders about eight months earlier (Jun. 1, 2019). Token holders a href="https://messari.io/article/eos-holders-vote-to-reduce-the-annual-inflation-from-5-to-1"signaled their preference/a to lower the network's 5% inflation rate to 1% and eliminate the function of the eosio.savings account, which had no defined use case despite collecting 80% of inflation rewards over the network's first eight months."

The CRC is a member-owned and operated organization whose purpose is to assess if a crypto asset, or its development, issuance, and use have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws. According to the CRC framework, a score of 5 results when an asset appears to have many characteristics that are consistent with the Howey-test factors. A score of 1 results when an asset appears to have few characteristics that are consistent with the Howey-test factors.

SEC lawsuit
On Sept. 30, 2019, the U.S. SEC <a href="https://messari.io/article/block-one-charged-by-sec-for-unregistered-securities-offering">charged</a> Block.one with conducting an unregistered securities offering related to its multi-billion token sale. The SEC order found that Block.one violated the registration provisions of the federal securities law by failing to register its token sale as a securities offering or seek proper exemptions. Block.one consented to the order without admitting or denying its findings and paid a $24 million civil penalty. But the SEC <a href="https://messari.io/article/mutability-in-crypto-and-recent-moves-by-the-sec-by-scott-kupor-a16z">did not require</a> Block.one or the EOS network to cease operations, leading to the assumption EOS reached a sufficient level of decentralization and its native token was no longer deemed securities.",

Unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, EOS token transfers do not require a fee, as users do not need to entice miners to include their transaction(s) in the next block. EOS block producers earn new tokens only through the creation of new blocks. But transactions are not entirely free because users and developers still need to acquire network resources in proportion to their intended on-chain activity levels.

The network resources required to submit transactions and run dApps include:
CPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)
NET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)
RAM: data storage

Users can stake EOS tokens directly to access CPU and NET, or they can lease these resources through EOS REX, an EOS-based resource exchange."

The network's current inflation rate is 1%, split between the Block Producers (BPs) and Standby Producers, who received 0.25% and 0.75% of the annual inflation rate respectively. While BPs must share a smaller piece of the total reward pool, there are only 21 BPs; thus, they receive more daily EOS rewards on average than their counterparts. Standby Producers represent potential block producers ranked outside of the top 21 that have enough voting support from token holders to receive a minimum daily reward of 100 EOS.

Historic supply and inflation changes
At launch, the inflation rate for EOS was 5%, but this metric was somewhat misleading as the network routed 4% of newly minted tokens into the eosio.saving account. The supply directed to this account was illiquid and only accessible by way of a successful vote among the network's 21 block producers (BPs). The rest of the outstanding inflation went to BPs and Standby Producers per the same percentage breakdown described above.

BPs can also vote on decreasing or increasing the inflation rate. Therefore, these network representatives can impact the future supply of EOS by altering the block reward or changing the contents of the eosio.saving account, an act that has happened twice since inception.

On May 8, 2019, BPs opted to burn all of the tokens collected in the eosio.saving account up until that point, which amounted to 34 million EOS. The inflation rate remained intact, however, so that account continued to accrue 80% of the newly issued (but still illiquid) EOS supply.

In Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.

Block.one vesting schedule
Block.one allocated itself 100 million EOS tokens at launch to fund future ecosystem development. These tokens will unlock linearly every second over a period of ten years starting from the network's Genesis Block on Jun. 6, 2018. In May 2019, Block.one claimed a vested batch of 9.8 million EOS and used 3.3 million of these tokens (worth ~$25 million at the time) to purchase network RAM. The firm now only holds the current and future rights to 96.7 million EOS tokens.

Impact of the eosio.ramfee account
Until May 1, 2019, and the launch of Resource Exchange (REX) on EOS Mainnet, the fees collected from RAM trading (0.5% of the value of each trade) were sent and stored on the eosio.ramfee account.  From May 1, 2019, the fees are now directly transferred from the eosio.ramfee to the REX, but the funds (approximately 2M EOS) that were located in the eosio.ramfee account before the upgrade will not be allocated to the REX and remain illiquid. 

Blacklisted accounts
EOSIO also has a feature that allows Block Producers to blacklist accounts. All the Block Producers need to blacklist an account in order for the blacklist to happen. Those blacklisted accounts' supply is considered illiquid since it is no longer transferable.  ",

technology: {
overview: {
technology_details: "Block.one built EOS with scalability as a primary objective. Beyond its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, EOS employs Graphene technology and (in the long-term) parallel processing to maximize performance.
Graphene technology: An open-course software toolkit developed by Dan Larimer that helps improve transaction processing capabilities. It is currently used by previous Larimer creations, Bitshares and Steem, as well as MUSE and Peerplay.
Parallel computation: Also referred to as horizontal scaling, this technology divides transactions and smart contract execution among multiple processors to help reduce the run time of a program. The first protocol version will operate on a single thread (i.e., a single processor) but will shift to a multithreaded platform in the future.

EOS requires users to obtain the following resources to submit transactions and run decentralized applications:
CPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)
NET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)
RAM: data storage

EOS holders receive CPU and NET by staking their tokens and receiving a proportional amount of the network resources. As a result, the network utilizes a no direct fee model where tokens give holders access to their pro-rata share of network resources. That being said, any operation needing storage or to create an account requires RAM to be purchased separately.

EOS uses the WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM), which offers high speed and performance as well as support for a multitude of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust, giving developers access to existing optimization and debugging tools.

Additionally, EOS implements human-readable names and account recovery solutions at the protocol level. Recovery is made possible with the designation of a recovery party that can reset the owner's keys with their approval. Unlike traditional multi-signature applications, the recovery partner has no control over the account other than helping the owner reset their keys.",

As a result, network activity spiked as users rushed to acquire the new token and flip it on exchanges like MXC Exchange that listed an EIDOS/a href="https://messari.io/asset/tether"$USDT/a trading pair. The rise in activity caused EOS to enter “congestion mode,” which limits the number of transactions a user can submit “to their pro-rata share” of total staked EOS resources. Coinbase also reported 95% of all EOS actions since Oct. 31 were related to the EIDOS contract.

onchain_governance: {
onchain_governance_type: "Delegated On-Chain Vote",
onchain_governance_details: "EOS features on-chain governance that processes voting through its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system. Similar to how EOS stakeholders vote on block producers, this model allows token holders to vote on protocol decisions that are automatically implemented or rejected depending on the final vote tally. Votes are weighted by the number of tokens held, and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Protocol decisions can consist of changes to the system parameters, updates to the User Agreement, or alterations on the inflation rate, among others.

__EOS Constitution replaced for the new User Agreement__
Block.one initially instituted a [Constitution](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/5068823fbc8a8f7d29733309c0496438c339f7dc/constitution.md) (now outdated) for the protocol, which consisted of various articles defining how users, developers, and validators should act on-chain. It served [as the](https://multicoin.capital/2018/04/24/eos-analysis-and-valuation/) "terms of service agreement in the software that bound stakeholders together through a set of bylaws." While well-intentioned, the Constitutional ran into some early roadblocks. Dan Larimer even proposed a new version that looked to remove the Arbitration Forum/establishment of the block producers as the jury and implement a supermajority vote required to freeze any account or contract, among other clarifications.

Despite Larimer's contribution, the community opted to develop its own solution, resulting in an open-source governance framework dubbed the EOS User Agreement. BPs [approved](https://steemit.com/eos/@lukestokes/the-eos-user-agreement-is-live) the User Agreement by a majority vote (15/21), and the agreement officially replaced the old Constitution in April 2019.

Learn more about the User Agreement and its eleven articles [here](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md)

Subgraphs are open source so anyone can use the APIs to build decentralized applications. Many Ethereum applications have already built subgraphs and use them today including: Audius, Uniswap, Opyn, ENS, DAOstack, Synthetix, Moloch and more.

description: "We are global, thematic investors in multiple asset classes: direct/indirect, public/private, funds and like to think about the world 10-20 years out. Our current primary themes include:

1/ competitive global currency devaluation: diversifying away from fiat currencies and paper assets into hard assets and crypto-currencies. We have some real estate and art but now prefer most of this exposure to be expressed via crypto-currecnies. We have invest in some crypto startups/funds, and are currently focused on the more liquid component of this including the trading of crypto-currencies (RV/directional, systematic/discretionary).

2/ technology: we prefer to express mostly through early-stage, smaller ($10M-100M) seed funds, and some direct investments (we are active on AngelList). We primarily invest in the U.S. but are active to a lesser extent globally in Emerging Market Internet (also through early-stage funds).

3/ bioscience: we primarily express through equity L/S exposure via hedge funds (low net and variable bias). We also prefer biotech exposure vs. the other areas of healthcare and life sciences.

4/ systematic trading: we prefer managed accounts vs hedge funds, and consider equities, FX and futures as the underlying instruments, with a sweetspot of hours to weeks as the typical holding periods.

5/ social-impact, mission-aligned investing (mostly through early stage start-ups as a founding Advisor/LP with a firm thats just about to launch) into for-profit businesses that are also affecting some tangible social good."

consensus_details: "Indexers are node operators in The Graph Network that stake Graph Tokens (GRT) in order to provide indexing and query processing services. Indexers earn query fees and indexer rewards for their services.

Curators are subgraph developers, data consumers or community members who signal to Indexers which APIs should be indexed by The Graph Network. Curators deposit GRT into a bonding curve to signal on a specific subgraph and earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on; incentivizing the highest quality data sources. Curators will curate on subgraphs and deposit GRT via the Graph Explorer dApp. Because this occurs on a bonding curve, that means that earlier signals gain greater share of the query fees on that subgraph for a given amount of GRT deposited. 

Delegators are individuals who would like to contribute to securing the network but do not want to run a Graph Node themselves. Delegators contribute by delegating GRT to existing Indexers and they earn a portion of query fees and indexing rewards in return. Delegators select Indexers based on their performance on measures like query fee rates, past slashing and uptime as well as delegator parameters like the cut of fees and rewards from the Indexer. Delegators will delegate and undelegate GRT on Indexers via the Graph Explorer dApp.

Consumers are the end-users of The Graph that query subgraphs and pay query fees to the Indexers, Curators and Delegators. Consumers are likely to be developers or projects themselves that cover query fees for their applications as they would AWS or cloud service costs. However, some applications will pass on query fees to users or bundle the cost in product fees. Consumers will pay for query fees via “gateways” or wallets that will be built on top of open source contracts in The Graph Network.

Indexers that stake GRT operate in a query marketplace where they earn query fees for indexing services and serving queries to subgraphs - like serving Uniswap trade data on Uniswap.info. The price of these queries will be set by Indexers and vary based on cost to index the subgraph, the demand for queries, the amount of curation signal and the market rate for blockchain queries. Since Consumers (ie. applications) are paying for queries, the aggregate cost is expected to be much lower than the costs of running a server and database.

A Gateway can be used to allow consumers to connect to the network and to facilitate payments. The team behind The Graph will initially run a set of gateways that allows applications to cover the query costs on behalf of their users. These gateways facilitate connecting to The Graph Network. Anyone will be able to run their own gateways as well. Gateways handle state channel logistics for query fees, and route to Indexers as a function of price, performance and security that is predetermined by the application paying for those queries.

In addition to query fees, Indexers and Delegators will earn indexing rewards in the form of GRT that is new token issuance distributed proportional to Curator signal and allocated stake. Indexing rewards will start at 3% annually. Future GRT monetary policy will be set by an independent technical governance which will be established as after network launch.

The Graph Network will have epochs which are measured in blocks and are used for the Indexing Rewards calculations.

In addition to query fees and indexing rewards, there is a Rebate Pool that rewards all network participants based on their contributions to The Graph Network. The rebate pool is designed to encourage Indexers to allocate stake in rough proportion to the amount of query fees they earn for the network.

GRT that is staked in the protocol is subject to a thawing period and can be slashed if Indexers are malicious and serve incorrect data to applications or if they index incorrectly. Curators and Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, yet there is a withdrawal tax on Curators and Delegators to disincentivize poor decision making that could harm the integrity of the network. Curators also earn fewer query fees if they choose to curate on a low-quality subgraph, since there will be fewer queries to process or fewer indexers to process those queries.

A portion of protocol query fees are burned, expected to start at ~1% of total protocol query fees and subject to future technical governance. The aforementioned withdrawal tax that is incurred by Curators and Delegators withdrawing their GRT is also burned, as well as any unclaimed rebate rewards.",

overview: {
technology_details: "The Graph learns what and how to index Ethereum data based on subgraph descriptions, known as the subgraph manifest. The subgraph description defines the smart contracts of interest for a subgraph, the events in those contracts to pay attention to, and how to map event data to data that The Graph will store in its database.

Subgraph
A subgraph is defined by a subgraph manifest, which is immutable and stored on IPFS. The immutability is important for having deterministic and reproducible queries for verification and dispute resolution. The GNS performs a much needed role by allowing teams to attach a name to a subgraph, which can then be used to point to consecutive immutable subgraph “versions.”

Indexer Staking
Indexers must stake Graph Tokens in order to sell their services in the query market. This serves two primary functions:

1) It provides economic security, as the staked GRT can be slashed if Indexers perform their work maliciously. Once GRT is staked, it may only be withdrawn subject to a thawing period, which provides ample opportunity for verification and dispute resolution.

2) It provides a _Sybil resistance _mechanism. Having fake or low quality Indexers on a given subgraph makes it slower to find quality service providers. For this reason The Graph only wants Indexers who have skin in the game to be discoverable.

The Graph will implement an incentive model pioneered by the team at 0x. It involves collecting a protocol fee on all transactions in the protocol, and then rebating those fees to participants as a function of their proportional stake and proportional fees collected for the network, using the Cobb-Douglas production function.

Curator Signaling
Curator signaling is the process of depositing GRT into a bonding curve for a subgraph to indicate to Indexers that the subgraph should be indexed.
Indexers can trust the signal because when curators deposit GRT into the bonding curve, they mint curation signal for the respective subgraph, entitling them to a portion of future query fees collected on that subgraph. A rationally self-interested curator should signal GRT toward subgraphs that they predict will generate fees for the network.
Using bonding curves—a type of algorithmic market maker where price is determined by a function—means that the more curation signal are minted, the higher the exchange rate between GRT and curation signal becomes. Thus, successful curators could take profits immediately if they feel that the value of future curation fees has been correctly priced in. Similarly, they should withdraw their GRT if they feel that the market has priced the value of curation signal too high.

Indexer Inflation Reward
This reward is intended to incentivize Indexers to index subgraphs that don’t yet have significant query volume. This helps to solve the bootstrapping problem for new subgraphs, which may not have pre-existing demand to attract Indexers.

Each subgraph in the network is allotted a portion of the total network inflation reward, based on the proportional amount of total curation signal that subgraph has. That amount, in turn, is divided between all the Indexers staked on that subgraph proportional to their amount of contributed stake.

During the bootstrapping phase, there is an incentive for Indexers to stake but not actually do the work of indexing and serving queries on any subgraphs.There will be an indexer monitoring service which is set via protocol governance. This service has the authority to add Indexers to a blacklist if they are found to be unavailable for serving queries on the subgraphs they are staked on.

Graph Explorer & Graph Name Service
Graph Explorer will be a dApp, built on top of a subgraph that indexes the Graph Protocol smart contracts—including the Graph Name Service (GNS), an on-chain registry of subgraphs.

The subgraph, along with other metadata stored in the GNS, allows users of Graph Explorer to get a better sense for the purpose and possible utility of a subgraph in a way that a random string of alphanumeric characters and compiled WASM byte code does not.
Rather than simply letting dApps build on multiple separate subgraphs, subgraph composition will allow brand new subgraphs to be built that directly reference entities from existing subgraphs. This reuse of the same subgraphs across many dApps and other subgraphs is one of the core efficiencies that The Graph unlocks.

Conditional Micropayments
The Graph Network will utilize state channels with ‘hub and spoke topology’ to minimize trust between the consumer and the Indexer.

This means that in order to use The Graph a consumer will need to have a state channel open on-chain with the state channel hub, which is loaded with their preferred stable token or ETH. The Indexers, meanwhile, will also need to have a state channel open with the hub where they can receive GRT.

The state channel hub will be collateralized with GRT and be responsible for setting the exchange rate between the payment denomination and GRT so that all micropayments are settled in the same unit of account.

Verification
In order for the WAVE Locks construction and indexer staking to be meaningful, there must be an effective verification mechanism that is capable of reproducing the work performed by an Indexer, identifying faults and slashing offending Indexers.

In the first phase of The Graph Network, this is handled through an on-chain dispute resolution process, which is decided through arbitration.

Fishermen submit disputes along with a bond, as well as an attestation signed by an Indexer. If the Indexer is found to have attested to an incorrect query response, the fisherman receives a portion of the slashed amount as a reward. Conversely, the fisherman’s bond is forfeit if the dispute is unsuccessful.

Initially, in the early days there will be a fisherman service where consumers may post attestations, and the Graph will take on the responsibility of verifying query responses and submitting disputes on-chain. Additionally, there will be an arbitration service set via protocol governance, which will act as the sole arbitrator in the dispute resolution",

background: {
background_details: "The Curve protocol was built around stablecoin liquidity in order to provide steadier interest returns without having to hold a very volatile asset. Since its inception, Curve has been a top DEX by volume, offering traders ample liquidity at low fees and slippage. Currently, Curve has over 33 different liquidity pools that provide varying and changing returns depending on the weights of assets in the pool and their performance.

Curve Finance began with the publication of Michael Egorov’s StableSwap Whitepaper in November 2019. The StableSwap whitepaper details the foundations of what eventually became Curve Finance protocol, which launched two months later in January 2020.

A key part of Curve’s infrastructure is the CurveDAO. The CurveDAO is an Aragon-based Decentralized Autonomous Organization that controls Curve Finance. Votes are weighted by both the number of votes and the time of the vote – earlier time-locked votes are worth more. The DAO is governed by CRV (an ERC-20 token), Curve's native governance token which launched in August of 2020. The launch of the CRV token led to a surge of volume and helped Curve hit over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) for the first time.

Curve aims to help liquidity providers maximize return while also minimizing trader fees, reducing price slippage, mitigate risk, and provide ample liquidity. It accomplishes this via unique tech and partnerships with other popular DeFi applications like Compound and Yearn Finance.",

Governance with time-weighted voting
Value capture mechanism to promote certain pools
Locking mechanism to accrue rewards for long term liquidity providers
Fee burn (once enabled by governance further down the road)

$CRV, an ERC-20 standard token, is Curve Finance's native coin for governance. The $CRV token controls the protocol and gives holders the ability to submit proposals and potential changes to the allocations of pools. Voters can examine each pool and decide on different allocations that may generate higher or more secure returns (APY). The amount of voting power a user has is determined by both the amount of $CRV tokens they stake and the amount of time they stake it. Users who have staked more tokens or for a longer period of time will possess greater voting rights. 

Users are incentivized to lock their $CRV tokens within the protocol in return for $veCRV tokens (vote locking address). Once these funds are locked for over a week, veCRV tokens will be available to vote for gauge weights. Also, those who lock $CRV are entitled to fees generated by the protocol’s liquidity pools. Currently, one needs 2500 $veCRV (the equivalent of 10000 $CRV locked for a year) to be able to create a new vote. This voting boost for users who lock their tokens serves as an incentive for users to truly invest themselves in the future of the Curve DAO. Vote locking also increases ones' CRV liquidity providing rewards."

launch_details: "Curve Finance launched their $CRV token on August 14th, 2020. The total supply of $CRV tokens to be issued is 3.03 billion with an initial supply of around 1.3 billion tokens. 

The initial supply of 1.3 billion is distributed as follows: 5% to pre-CRV liquidity providers (with 1 year vesting, where 1/365 of rewards unlock every 24 hours), 30% to the Curve team and investors, 3% to employees (with 2 year vesting), and 5% to the community reserve.The fully diluted 3.03 billion in supply will be distributed as follows: 62% goes to liquidity providers, 30% to team and investors (with 2-4 year vesting), 3% to employees (with 2 year vesting) and 5% to the community reserve. 

This distribution schedule meant for the first year about 2 million new CRV tokens (~0.067% of the supply) where distributed each day. After the initial 1.3 billion is distributed, the remaining supply will be issued at a decreasing weight of 2.25 per year; this means the supply will not be fully diluted until around the year 2320.

The stated goal of the Curve token distribution is to slowly shift voting power from the Curve team and investors to the liquidity providers."

overview: {
technology_details: "Constant Sum Constant Product AMM:
The Curve protocol employs a unique Automated Market Maker that combines Uniswap's constant product AMM with a constant sum AMM. Curve's AMM equation is complex but the results are simple – low slippage on small to medium trades and decent liquidity on larger ones.

Curves model, which provides a 'middle-ground' between constant price and Uniswap's AMM model (x*y = constant product),  achieves significantly lower slippage in prices on the demand side of the exchange.
To learn more about Curve's AMM Model see <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-the-constant-function-market-maker">The Evolution of the Constant Function Market Maker</a>

Liquidity Providers:
Curve operates via liquidity pools where two (or more) assets are deposited into a pool and traded against each other. Arbitrage keeps the prices of the assets even with prices on other exchanges and half of the 0.04% fee (taken from trades) is paid to LPs. The other half of the 0.04% fee is paid to veCRV holders. At higher volumes of trade the APY on deposited assets increases – more trades means more fees are being paid. Curve's 0.04% fee is much lower than other exchanges, which could explain the high levels of trading volume it has hosted.

All LPs receive CRV tokens in addition to the interest from fees. When depositing LPs should put assets in pools in an equal ratio (50/50). If they don't the AMM equation will devalue one of the coins letting arbitrageurs bid some of the value out of their deposit.

On top of the fee paid to LPs, Curve incentivizes deposits via rewards from other DeFi projects. Currently, protocols REN and Synthetix incentive LPs to deposit in pools containing their assets by giving LPs their respective tokens ($REN and $SNX).

yEarn:
Some of Curve's pools, called yPools, are pools that have integrated with lending and borrowing protocols like Compound and Yearn Finance. yEarn is the algorithm that provides liquidity to these protocols and works to get the best rate of return on the lent assets. yPools lend funds to the protocols and in return, these pools give LPs rewards in cTokens and Ytokens. Much like a bank lends its customers' savings in order to return them higher interest rates, Curve's goal with this practice is to maximize rewards for those willing to provide stablecoin liquidity on their platform.

Impermanent Loss:
Impermanent loss is the loss that occurs to LPs when the price of one of the two assets that exist in a pool, say DAI/ETH, is more volatile than the other. If the price of one of the assets swings in relation to the other asset but does not change within the liquidity pool itself arbitragers can buy the asset from the pool and sell it on another exchange. LPs lose the gains made on their assets because the profit made from the bidding up of ETH was essentially drained by arbitragers. 

However, so long as the LPs do not withdraw their funds, the loss remains impermanent; the price of the asset could go back to its previous level, meaning the LPs would not have actually made any more money if they had just held the assets themselves. LPs are incentivized to deposit funds so long as the fees and yield paid to them exceeds the impermanent loss. 

Several DEXs, including Curve, are working on solutions to Impermanent Loss. Curve recently partnered with Peanut, a "DeFi price balancer", to explore the possibility of preventing impermanent loss. Curve LPs typically have a much lower risk of impermanent loss – the only assets traded on Curve are stable so typically any impermanent loss would be negligible. 

Copy-cat:
An EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible version of Curve is being built on Polkadot. The team behind Polkadot's Curve is not affiliated with Curve itself.

Integrations:
Curve Finance has integrated with 1inch, Paraswap, Totle swap Dex.ag, Debank, InstaDapp DSA, CoinGecko, Zapper.fi, Zerion, Pools.fyi, Spells.fyi, dydx, Etherscan, and CoinMarketCap.

background: {
background_details: "The Maker protocol is an open-source project started in 2014 with the goal of creating a permissionless credit system that would allow users to take out loans collateralized by cryptocurrency. These loans are created by smart contracts that mint <a href="https://messari.io/asset/dai">Dai</a>, a stablecoin with a soft peg to the US dollar. The protocol was built by the Maker Foundation along with a number of outside parties and over time the foundation has worked to reduce its level of control. They have gradually ceded control to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO which governs the protocol. The DAO is comprised of individuals across the globe that own the MKR token which affords holders the right to vote on important changes.

Single Collateral Dai
The first iteration was known as Single Collateral Dai (SCD) because Ethereum was the only asset used as collateral to take out a loan. It launched in December 2017 and grew to support $100 million worth of debt. Despite a 94% decrease in the value of collateral over that time, the system remained healthy and Dai maintained a close peg to $1. Since Dai was the only widespread stablecoin that did not require a company to back it by holding US dollars, it became an integral piece of the growing decentralized finance ecosystem. While SCD proved to be effective, the intended goal was to transition to Multi Collateral Dai (MCD) that could accept collateral other than Dai as well as implement other key design changes.

Transition to Multi Collateral Dai
In November 2019 MakerDAO <a href="https://messari.io/article/multi-collateral-dai-is-live">upgraded</a> the protocol to MCD with Basic Attention Token (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bat">BAT</a>) being voted as the first additional collateral available. The existing single collateral system continues to function as is while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Eventually, the single collateral system will be phased out altogether. In addition to the new collateral, MCD made other important design changes such as the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which allows Dai holders to earn yield and collateral auctions that create a competitive market for liquidations.

Internal controversy
Towards the end of 2018, the Maker Ecosystem Growth Fund (MEGF) was established to oversee the treasury of MKR tokens by nine board members chosen by the CEO Rune Christensen. According to a document from the former CTO Andy Milenius, titled ”Zandy’s Story”, after some disagreements as to how the fund was to be allocated, Rune presented two divergent choices. The “red pill” was for those who would follow his lead and focus on government compliance and integration into the existing financial system while the blue pill for those who didn’t want a formal organizational structure and would work on MCD and then cease to be funded. However, there was one group that wanted to explore alternative options that called themselves the Purple Pill. When this group was discovered it was seen as conspiratorial and five members of the board that were members of the Purple Pill group were subsequently fired. Those members then sent a legal letter stating they were wrongfully terminated.",

Dai is a currency token that seeks to maintain price stability against a specific peg, currently the U.S. dollar, to make it suitable for short-term and medium-term use as a means of exchange and store of value. Tokens with these characteristics are commonly referred to as <a href="https://messari.io/article/stablecoins">stablecoins</a>.

The MKR token is used for governance of the platform allowing holders to vote on various parameters such as the stability fee, debt ceiling, types of collateral to be used, Dai Savings Rate and more. MKR is also used to purchase excess Dai from collateral auctions and stability fee payments in the Surplus Auction. Once the auction is ended the protocol automatically burns the MKR leading to a decreasing supply. However, if there is a shortfall of Dai resulting from loans becoming undercollateralized, a Debt Auction will occur to raise more Dai by printing MKR, thereby increasing the supply. "

overview: {
technology_details: "Vaults (formerly “collateralized debt positions - CDPs)
The key component of the Maker protocol and method with which Dai is created is known as a Vault. A Vault is created by depositing collateral into a smart contract which then mints an amount of Dai specified by the user. The dollar value of the collateral must be greater than 150% the value of Dai (current Collateralization Ratio). The user can transact freely with their Dai. If they want to receive their initial collateral they must pay back both the Dai they withdrew plus the interest rate on the loan (Stability Fee). If at any point, the value of the collateral drops below the collateralization ratio, then their position is subject to liquidations where anyone can come in and purchase the underlying collateral to repay the debt. Known as Keepers, these actors are motivated by the profit opportunity from buying the collateral below market price and then selling on the open market.

Auctions
There are three types of auctions
Surplus Auctions occur when loans remain overcollateralized and payments from stability fees reach a certain amount. After that, Dai is auctioned off to Keepers for MKR which is then subsequently destroyed.
Collateral Auctions occur when Vaults drop below the Collateralization Ratio. The collateral in the vault is then sold until the outstanding debt is repaid plus a liquidation penalty. At that point, the auction becomes a reverse auction, where a bidder bids on accepting smaller parts of collateral for that fixed amount of Dai. Once the process ends, the remaining collateral is returned to the vault owner.
Debt Auctions occur in the worst-case scenario when the price of collateral drops precipitously such that it can no longer cover the entire debt paid. The system will first look towards the surplus from Stability Fees to cover the debt. If that is not sufficient, a reverse auction occurs to cover the fixed amount of Dai necessary to make the system whole. Bidders compete on willingness to accept decreasing amounts of MKR for the shortfall in Dai.

Dai Savings Rate (DSR)
The DSR was implemented in MCD as a way for Dai holders to earn interest on their holdings. Users can deposit Dai into a non-custodial smart contract and immediately begin earning interest funded by Stability Fee payments. They are also free to withdraw at any time. The DSR serves as a monetary policy tool for governance to control the outstanding supply of Dai in order to manage the $1 peg. If the peg were to drop below $1, MKR holders could vote to increase the DSR. This would incentivize Dai holders to lock more Dai up, decreasing the supply and ideally bringing the price back up.",

The Governance Security Module delay has since been changed to allow 24-hours for changes to be implemented to allow MKR holders to trigger a Emergency Shutdown if an attack like this were to occur. "

governance: {
governance_details: "The Maker protocol is ultimately governed by the MKR holders, where one token equals one vote. Anyone is free to submit a proposal which then goes through a Governance Poll to establish rough community consensus. Polls can be proactive to account for one-off or intermittent issues that need to be addressed for future issues, or they can be reactive to respond to a present state change. Once there is general agreement, the issue is put up for an Executive Vote where MKR holders vote to enact the change.

Examples of changes that can be made include:
New collateral types with their own unique risk parameters such as Collateralization Ratio and debt ceiling
Selection of oracle feeds to input the market price of various collateral assets
Modifications to the Stability Fee or Dai Savings Rate
Allocations of funds from the Maker Buffer which include the totally system’s revenues from Liquidation and Stability Fees
Triggering Emergency Shutdown

Emergency Shutdown
A critical component of Maker governance is the Emergency Shutdown capability. It serves two functions: to shutdown the old system in the event of a major upgrade as we will see with single collateral Dai, or as a last resort mechanism in the event of any malicious governance activity, attack or security breach. Once 50,000 MKR are placed in the Emergency Shutdown Module, it is enacted immediately to shut down the system and return collateral to Dai holders and Vault owners. Vault owners can withdraw their collateral minus the Dai debt owed which is then available for Dai holders through the main collateral claim process. This is a manual process where Dai holders use Dai to claim collateral at a fixed rate corresponding to the calculated value based on the Dai Target Price. In receiving their proportional claim of the collateral portfolio they could be at risk of a haircut due to the risk in decline of collateral value.

Governance Security Module (GSM)
After an Executive Vote gets passed, there is a 24-hour delay period before the change gets deployed to give stakeholders time to review the code and maintain the integrity of the system. If they believe the change is detrimental to the system, MKR holders can opt for an Emergency Shutdown so that all stakeholders receive their fair value currently locked in the system.

onchain_governance: {
onchain_governance_type: "Direct On-Chain Vote",
onchain_governance_details: "While Governance Polls are conducted over discrete time periods to gauge community consensus, Executive Votes are continuous and represent the state of the system at all times. At any point in time, a proposal can be introduced that represents a new state of the protocol, which means MKR holders must continuously monitor for these changes and vote accordingly. In order to vote, MKR holders need to keep their tokens in a voting construct where they are then free to shift to competing proposals. Therefore the expectation is that MKR holders will play an active role in governance, deciding how the system evolves over time.",
